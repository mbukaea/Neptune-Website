\chapter{Design Justification File}\label{sec:DJF}
The Design Justification File (DJF) is generated and reviewed at all stages of the development
and review processes.  It contains the documents that describe the trade-offs, design choice
justifications, verification plan, validation plan, validation testing specification,
test procedures, test results, evaluations and any other documentation called for to justify
the design of the software.
