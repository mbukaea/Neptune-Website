Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of two optimal discontinuous
   finite element (FE) Riemann methods and their application to the
   one-speed Boltzmann transport equation in the steady-state. The
   proposed methods optimise the amount of dissipation applied in the
   streamline direction. This dissipation is applied within in element
   using it novel Riemann FE method, which is based on an analogy between
   control volume discretisation methods and finite element methods when
   integration by parts is applied to the transport terms. In
   one-dimension the optimal finite element solutions match the analytical
   solution exactly at each outlet node. Both schemes couple elements in
   space via a Riemann approach. The first of the two schemes is it
   Petrov-Galerkin (PG) method which introduces dissipation via the
   equation residual. The second scheme uses a streamline diffusion
   stabilisation term in the discretisation. These two methods provide a
   discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) scheme that call stabilise ail
   element across the full range of radiation regimes, obtaining robust
   solutions with suppressed oscillation. Three basis functions in angle
   of particle travel have been implemented in ail optimal DPG Riemann
   solver, which include the P-N (spherical harmonic), S-N (discrete
   ordinate) and LWN (linear octahedral wavelet) angular expansions. These
   methods are applied to it series of demanding two-dimensional radiation
   transport problems. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A discontinuous Galerkin implementation of a domain decomposition
   method for kinetic-hydrodynamic coupling multiscale problems in gas

Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a domain decomposition method (DDM), based on
   the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) and the local discontinuous Galerkin
   (LDG) methods, for solving multiscale problems involving macro
   sub-domains, where a macro model is valid, and micro sub-domains, where
   the macro model is not valid and a more costly micro model must be
   used. We take two examples, one from compressible gas dynamics where
   the micro sub-domains are around shocks, contacts and corners of
   rarefaction fans, and another one from semiconductor device simulations
   where the micro subdomains are around the jumps in the doping profile.
   The macro model is taken as the Euler equations for the gas dynamics
   problem and as a hydrodynamic model and a high field model for the
   semiconductor device problem. The micro model for both problems is
   taken as a kinetic equation. We pay special attention to the effective
   coupling between the macro subdomains and the micro sub-domains, in
   which we utilize the advantage of the discontinuous Galerkin method in
   its compactness of the computational stencil. Numerical results
   demonstrate the effectiveness of our DDM-DG method in solving such
   multi-scale problems. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Simulation of silicon semiconductor devices by means of a direct

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a new deterministic
   solution method to the coupled Boltzmann-Poisson system for simulating
   semiconductor devices.
   Design/methodology/approach - A non-parabolic six-valley model allows
   for the investigation of anisotropy effects. The solution method is
   based on a discontinuous piecewise polynomial approximation of the
   carrier distribution function. Integrating the Boltzmann equation over
   tiny cells of the phase space leads to a system of ordinary
   differential equations. The Poisson equation is selfconsistently solved
   by applying a finite element Galerkin approach.
   Findings - Good agreement with shock-capturing ``WENO solutions{''} is
   obtained for n(+)-n-n(+) silicon diodes. The anisotropy due to the
   six-valley model affects considerably macroscopic quantities at the
   beginning of the transients. The method is also applicable to spatially
   two-dimensional problems.
   Research limitations/implications - The presented method is extendable
   by including full band structure data, although the method is much
   easier applicable when analytical band structure models can be used.
   Practical implications - The new model is an efficient tool to acquire
   transport coefficients for device simulations or to directly simulate
   one- or two-dimensional submicron devices on a kinetic level.
   Originality/value - New grounds are broken by introducing a fast finite
   volume method for solving the Boltzmann equation in the spirit of
   finding a weak solution. The presented model is a good choice for the
   simulation of anisotropy effects in silicon semiconductor devices.}},
