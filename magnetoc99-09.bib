Abstract = {{Polarized light provides the most reliable source of information at our
   disposal for diagnosing the physical properties of astrophysical
   plasmas, including the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the solar
   atmosphere. Here we formulate and solve the 3D radiative transfer
   problem of the linear polarization of the solar continuous radiation,
   which is principally produced by Rayleigh and Thomson scattering. Our
   approach takes into account not only the anisotropy of the solar
   continuum radiation but also the symmetry-breaking effects caused by
   the horizontal atmospheric inhomogeneities produced by the solar
   surface convection. We show that such symmetry-breaking effects do
   produce observable signatures in Q/I and U/I, even at the very center
   of the solar disk where we observe the forward scattering case, but
   their detection would require obtaining very high resolution linear
   polarization images of the solar surface. Without spatial and/or
   temporal resolution U/I approximate to 0 and the only observable
   quantity is Q/I, whose wavelength variation at a solar disk position
   close to the limb has been recently determined semi-empirically.
   Interestingly, our 3D radiative transfer modeling of the polarization
   of the Sun's continuous spectrum in a well-known 3D hydrodynamical
   model of the solar photosphere shows remarkable agreement with the
   semi-empirical determination, significantly better than that obtained
   via the use of one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric models. Although this
   result confirms that the above-mentioned 3D model was indeed a suitable
   choice for our Hanle-effect estimation of the substantial amount of
   ``hidden{''} magnetic energy that is stored in the quiet solar
   photosphere, we have found however some small discrepancies whose
   origin may be due to uncertainties in the semi-empirical data and/or in
   the thermal and density structure of the 3D model. For this reason, we
   have paid some attention also to other (more familiar) observables,
   like the center-limb variation of the continuum intensity, which we
   have calculated taking into account the scattering contribution to the
   continuum source function. The overall agreement with the observed
   center-limb variation turns out to be impressive, but we find a hint
   that the model's temperature gradients in the continuum-forming layers
   could be slightly too steep, perhaps because all current simulations of
   solar surface convection and magnetoconvection compute the radiative
   flux divergence ignoring the fact that the effective polarizability is
   not completely negligible, especially in the downward-moving
   intergranular lane plasma.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoconvection of an electrically conducting fluid in a square
   cavity with partially thermally active sidewalls is investigated
   numerically. Temperature of one of the thermally active regions of the
   side walls is periodic in time while the opposite wall is isothermal.
   The horizontal walls and the remaining parts of the side walls are

   positions of the active zones are considered. The governing equations
   are discretized by the control volume method with QUICK scheme and
   solved numerically by SIMPLE algorithm for the pressure-velocity
   coupling together with under relaxation technique. The tests were
   carried out for various values of amplitude, period, Grashof number,
   Hartmann number and Prandtl number. The heat transfer characteristics
   are presented in the form of streamlines, isotherms and velocity
   profiles both for transient and steady state. It is observed that the
   flow and the heat transfer rate in the cavity are affected by the
   sinusoidal temperature profile and by the magnetic field at lower
   values of Grashof number. The rate of heat transfer oscillates for
   increasing periods but it is maximum for Omega = 3 and it is found to
   be an increasing function of amplitude but decreases for higher values
   of Hartmann number. The heat transfer rate is maximum for the
   middle-middle thermally active locations while it is poor for the top

Abstract = {{Aims. We study the dependence of turbulent transport coefficients, such

   number in the presence of helical forcing.
   Methods. We use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations with
   periodic boundary conditions and measure the turbulent transport
   coefficients using the kinematic test field method. In all cases the
   magnetic Prandtl number is taken as unity.
   Results. We find that with increasing shear the diagonal components of
   alpha(ij) quench, whereas those of eta(ij) increase. The antisymmetric
   parts of both tensors increase with increasing shear. We also propose a
   simple expression for the turbulent pumping velocity (or gamma effect).
   This pumping velocity is proportional to the kinetic helicity of the
   turbulence and the vorticity of the mean flow. For negative helicity,
   i.e. for a positive trace of alpha(ij), it points in the direction of
   the mean vorticity, i.e. perpendicular to the plane of the shear flow.
   Our simulations support this expression for low shear and magnetic

Abstract = {{Results of a three-dimensional MHD simulation of a sunspot with a
   photospheric size of about 20 Mm are presented. The simulation has been
   carried out with the MURaM code, which includes a realistic equation of
   state with partial ionization and radiative transfer along many ray
   directions. The largely relaxed state of the sunspot shows a division
   in a central dark umbral region with bright dots and a penumbra showing
   bright filaments of about 2-3 Mm length with central dark lanes. By a
   process similar to the formation of umbral dots, the penumbral
   filaments result from magnetoconvection in the form of upflow plumes,
   which become elongated by the presence of an inclined magnetic field;
   the upflow is deflected in the outward direction while the magnetic
   field is weakened and becomes almost horizontal in the upper part of
   the plume near the level of optical depth unity. A dark lane forms
   owing to the piling up of matter near the cusp-shaped top of the rising
   plume that leads to an upward bulging of the surfaces of constant
   optical depth. The simulated penumbral structure corresponds well to
   the observationally inferred interlocking-comb structure of the
   magnetic field with Evershed outflows along dark-laned filaments with
   nearly horizontal magnetic field and overturning perpendicular
   ({''}twisting{''}) motion, which are embedded in a background of
   stronger and less inclined field. Photospheric spectral lines are
   formed at the very top and somewhat above the upflow plumes, so that
   they do not fully sense the strong flow as well as the large field
   inclination and significant field strength reduction in the upper part

Abstract = {{Context. Small-scale magnetic fields play an important role in the
   structure and the dynamics of the solar atmosphere.
   Aims. This study aims at revealing the evolution of magnetic fields,
   together with granular convection in the quiet Sun by means of
   observations with high spatial, spectral, and temporal resolution and
   of numerical MHD simulations.
   Methods. Time sequences from quiet Sun disc centre were obtained with
   the upgraded ``Gottingen{''} Fabry-Perot spectropolarimeter at the
   Vacuum Tower Telescope, Observatorio del Teide/Tenerife, in the Fe I
   6173 angstrom line. The data were reconstructed with speckle methods.
   For comparison with the observations, numerical simulations of granular
   magnetoconvection were carried out with the MURaM code. The intensities
   and Stokes vectors emerging from the simulation box were degraded in
   wavelength, spatial co-ordinates, and noise to the quality of the
   observations.
   Results. The noise in the observed magnetograms from the
   centre-of-gravity method is sigma(B) approximate to 2 G, yielding a
   polarimetric sensitivity of 3 x 10(15) Mx, at a cadence of 23 s with 0
   `'.33 spatial resolution in a field of view of similar to 33 `' x 25
   `'. Many of the observed V profiles in network and internetwork (IN)
   areas exhibit strong asymmetries that indicate strong
   magnetoconvection. The temporal evolutions of IN structures and of a
   bright point (BP), as seen in broadband and line-minimum images, in
   Dopplergrams, and in magnetograms, are presented. The magnetic field
   structure in the numerical MHD simulations is even more complex than
   seen in the observations. Correspondingly, the emergent Stokes profiles
   are often very abnormal. The degradation yields a reduction of the
   intrinsic field strength to the ``observed{''} one by a factor 4-5. The
   spectral resolution of the spectrometer is adequate, yet the limitation
   in spatial resolution and by noise filtering swamps the details seen in
   the non-degraded simulations. A BP was not found in the simulations,
   presumably because BP's are not so common and the simulated box is
   quiet small: only 6 Mm wide in both horizontal directions.
   Conclusions. The combination of high-resolution observations with
   numerical simulation is a highly valuable means for studying
   small-scale magnetic fields on the Sun. Two-dimensional, low-noise data
   with spectral resolution as good as achieved here and with spatial
   resolution of 0 `'.1 and better are needed to better understand this
   important part of the solar magnetism.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. We estimate the minimum length on which solar granulation can be

   Methods. We measure the variation in the bright difference between two
   pixels in images of the solar granulation for different distances
   between the pixels. This scale-dependent data is empirically analyzed
   to find the minimum scale on which the process can be considered
   Markovian.
   Results. The results suggest that the solar granulation can be
   considered to be a Markovian process on scales longer than r(M) =
   300-500 km. On longer length scales, solar images can be considered to
   be a Markovian stochastic process that consists of structures of size
   rM. Smaller structures exhibit correlations on many scales
   simultaneously yet cannot be described by a hierarchical cascade in
   scales. An analysis of the longitudinal magnetic-flux density indicates
   that it cannot be a Markov process on any scale.
   Conclusions. The results presented in this paper constitute a stringent
   test for the realism of numerical magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of
   solar magneto-convection. In future exhaustive analyse, the
   non-Markovian properties of the magnetic flux density on all analyzed

Abstract = {{In the framework of mean-field electrodynamics the coefficients
   defining the mean electromotive force in Galloway-Proctor flows are
   determined. These flows show a two-dimensional pattern and are helical.
   The pattern wobbles in its plane. Apart from one exception a circularly
   polarized Galloway-Proctor flow, i.e. a circular motion of the flow
   pattern is assumed. This corresponds to one of the cases considered
   recently by Courvoisier, Hughes \& Tobias. An analytic theory of the
   alpha effect and related effects in this flow is developed within the
   second-order correlation approximation and a corresponding fourth-order
   approximation. In the validity range of these approximations there is
   an alpha effect but no gamma effect, or pumping effect. Numerical
   results obtained with the test-field method, which are independent of
   these approximations, confirm the results for alpha and show that gamma
   is in general non-zero. Both alpha and gamma show a complex dependency
   on the magnetic Reynolds number and other parameters that define the
   flow, that is, amplitude and frequency of the circular motion. Some
   results for the magnetic diffusivity eta(t) and a related quantity are
   given, too. Finally, a result for a in the case of alpha randomly
   varying linearly polarized Galloway-Proctor flow, without the
   aforementioned circular motion, is presented. The flows investigated
   show quite interesting effects. There is, however, no straightforward
   way to relate these flows to turbulence and to use them for studying

Abstract = {{The properties of solar magnetic fields on scales less than the spatial

   their immediate surroundings on the solar surface with unsigned
   magnetic flux densities of 300 and 140 G. In the first region from the
   probability density functions of the magnetic field strength it is
   found that the most probable field strength at log tau(5) = 0 is equal
   to 250 G. Weak fields (B < 500 G) occupy about 70\% of the surface,
   whereas stronger fields (B > 1000 G) occupy only 9.7\% of the surface.
   The magnetic flux is -28 G and its imbalance is -0.04. In the second
   region, these parameters are correspondingly equal to 150 G, 93.3\%,
   0.3\%, -40 G, and -0.10. The distribution of line-of-sight velocities
   on the surface of log tau(5) = -1 is estimated. The mean velocity is
   equal to 0.4 km s(-1) in the first simulated region. The average
   velocity in the granules is -1.2 km s(-1) and in the intergranules it
   is 2.5 km s(-1). In the second region, the corresponding values of the

   asymmetry of synthetic Stokes V profiles of the Fe I 1564.8 nm line is

   exceed 1\%. The spatially smoothed amplitude asymmetry is increased to
   10\% whereas the area asymmetry is only slightly varied.}},

   passive and dynamic quantities. One key quantity of interest is a
   magnetic field, a dynamic vector quantity, that can drastically alter
   the convectively driven flows, and have an important role in coupling
   the different layers. In this Letter we present the first investigation

Abstract = {{Using direct simulations, weakly non-linear theory and non-linear
   mean-field theory, it is shown that the quenched velocity field of a
   saturated non-linear dynamo can itself act as a kinematic dynamo. The
   flow is driven by a forcing function that would produce a Roberts flow
   in the absence of a magnetic field. This result confirms an analogous
   finding by Cattaneo \& Tobias for the more complicated case of
   turbulent convection, suggesting that this may be a common property of
   non-linear dynamos; see also the talk given online at the Kavli
   Institute for Theoretical Physics
   (http://online.kitp.ucsb.edu/online/dynamo\_c08/cattaneo). It is argued
   that this property can be used to test non-linear mean-field dynamo
   theories.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Umbral Dots (UDs) are thought to be manifestations of
   magnetoconvection in sunspot umbrae. Recent advances in their
   theoretical description point to the need for a thorough study of their
   properties and evolution based on data with the highest currently
   achievable resolution.
   Aims. Our UD analysis aims to provide parameters such as lifetimes,
   diameters, horizontal velocities, and peak intensities, as well as the
   evolution of selected parameters.
   Methods. We present a 106-min TiO (705.7 nm) time series of high
   spatial and temporal resolution that contains thousands of UDs in the
   umbra of a mature sunspot in the active region NOAA 10667 at mu = 0.95.
   The data were acquired with the 1-m Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) on La
   Palma. With the help of a multilevel tracking (MLT) algorithm the
   sizes, brightnesses, and trajectories of 12 836 umbral dots were found
   and extensively analyzed. The MLT allows UDs with very low contrast to
   be reliably identified.
   Results. Inside the umbra we determine a UD filling factor of 11\%. The
   histogram of UD lifetimes is monotonic, i.e. a UD does not have a
   typical lifetime. Three quarters of the UDs lived for less than 150 s
   and showed no or little motion. The histogram of the UD diameters
   exhibits a maximum at 225 km, i.e. most of the UDs are spatially
   resolved. UDs display a typical horizontal velocity of 420 ms(-1) and a
   typical peak intensity of 51\% of the mean intensity of the quiet
   photosphere, making them on average 20\% brighter than the local umbral
   background. Almost all mobile UDs (large birth-death distance) were
   born close to the umbra-penumbra boundary, move towards the umbral
   center, and are brighter than average. Notably bright and mobile UDs
   were also observed along a prominent UD chain, both ends of which are
   located at the umbra-penumbra boundary. Their motion started primarily
   at either of the ends of the chain, continued along the chain, and
   ended near the chain's center. We observed the splitting and merging of
   UDs and the temporal succession of both. For the first time the
   evolution of brightness, size, and horizontal speed of a typical UD
   could be determined in a statistically significant way. Considerable
   differences between the evolution of central and peripheral UDs are
   found, which point to a difference in origin.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The development of magnetoconvection in a sheared magnetic field is
   investigated. The equilibrium magnetic field B-0 is horizontal and its
   orientation varies linearly along the vertical axis. Preliminary
   consideration of the transition from the inertial to the viscous regime
   of the gravitational resistive interchange instability, reveals that
   the latter is characterized by the existence of viscoresistive boundary
   layers of vertical width which scales as Q(-1/6), where Q is the
   Chandrasekhar number. The situation is analogous to the one encountered
   in magnetically confined laboratory plasmas, where convective flows are
   constrained by the magnetic shear to develop in boundary layers located
   around resonant magnetic surfaces in order to fulfill the ``interchange
   condition{''} k.B-0=0, where k is the wave vector of the magnetic
   perturbation. It follows that when the effect of thermal diffusion is
   taken into account in the process, convection can only occur above a
   certain critical value of the Rayleigh number which scales as Q(2/3)
   for large Q. At the onset, the convection pattern is a superposition of
   identically thin convective rolls everywhere aligned with the local
   magnetic field lines and which therefore adopt the magnetic field
   geometry, a situation also reminiscent of the penumbra of sunspots.
   Using this degeneracy, equations describing the weakly nonlinear state
   are obtained and discussed. A reduced magnetohydrodynamic description
   of magnetoconvection is introduced. Since it is valid for arbitrary
   magnetic field configurations, it allows a simple extension to the case
   where there exists an inclination between the direction of gravity and
   the plane spanned by the equilibrium magnetic field. These reduced
   magnetohydrodynamic equations are proposed as a powerful tool for
   further investigations of magnetoconvection in more complex field line

Abstract = {{In mean-field dynamo theory, the electromotive force term u' B' due to
   small-scale fields connects the small-scale magnetic field with the
   large-scale field. This term is usually approximated as the -effect,
   assumed to be instantaneous in time and local in space. However, the
   approximation is valid only when the magnetic Reynolds number Rm is
   much less than unity, and is inappropriate when Rm number 1, which is
   the condition satisfied in the Earth's core or solar convection zone.
   We introduce a function qr as a non-local and non-instantaneous
   generalization of the usual -effect and examine its behaviour as a
   function of Rm in the range 1/64 Rm 10 for a kinematic dynamo model. We
   use the flow of G.O. Roberts 1972 (Phil, Trans. Roy. Soc. London Ser.
   A, 1972, 271, 411-454), which is steady and has non-zero helicities and
   two-dimensional periodicity. As a result, we identify three regions in
   Rm space according to the behaviour of the function qr: (i) Rm 1/4,
   where the function qr is local and instantaneous and can be
   approximated by the traditional and effects, (ii) 1/4 Rm 4, where the
   deviation from the traditional and effects increases and non-localness
   and non-instantaneousness increase, and (iii) Rm number 4, where
   boundary layers develop fully and non-localness and
   non-instantaneousness are prominent. We show that the non-local memory
   effect for Rm number 4 strongly affects the dynamo action and explains
   an observed augmentation of the growth rate in the dispersion relation.
   The results imply that the non-local memory effect of the electromotive
   force should be important in the geodynamo or the solar dynamo.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Pores are among the photospheric features that form when the

   light bridges are bright features that separate umbral areas into two
   or more irregular regions.
   Aims. We study the structure of a solar pore (AR10812) with a light
   bridge. Methods. We analyzed both broad-band and narrow-band images
   acquired with the Interferometric BI-dimensional Spectrometer at the
   adaptive optics channel of the NSO/Dunn Solar Telescope. Narrow-band
   images acquired in the photospheric Fe I709.04 nm line were used to
   determine the line-of-sight velocity field.
   Results. The roundish shape of the pore allows us to derive the radial
   profiles of both intensity and vertical velocity. The pore has a
   downward velocity, of about -200 m s(-1), and is surrounded by an
   annular downflow structure with an average velocity of about -300 m
   s(-1) with respect to the nearby quiet sun.
   The light bridge shows a long narrow dark structure running along its
   axis. Corresponding to this dark lane, we measure a weak upflow of
   about 70 m s(-1), flanked by a downflow of about 150 m s(-1) with
   respect to the pore. The topology of this velocity structure resembles
   a convective roll.
   The anticorrelation between continuum intensity and photospheric
   velocity may be due to the higher gas pressure in a photospheric
   field-free cusp, above the light bridge, located between two magnetic
   walls. We present an analytical model capable of reproducing the
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Context. The quiet Sun presents magnetized plasma whose field strengths
   vary from zero to about 2 kG. The probability density function of the
   magnetic field strength B efficaciously describes the statistical
   properties of the quiet Sun magnetic field.
   Aims. We simulate the dynamics and the evolution of quiet Sun magnetic
   elements to produce a probability density function of the field
   strengths associated with such elements.
   Methods. The dynamics of the magnetic field are simulated by means of a
   numerical model in which magnetic elements are driven passively by an
   advection field characterized by spatio-temporal correlations that
   mimick the granulation and mesogranulation scales observed on the solar
   surface. The field strength can increase due to an amplification
   process that occurs where the magnetic elements converge. Starting from
   a delta-like probability density function centered on B = 30 G, we
   obtain magnetic field strengths of up to 2 kG (in absolute value). To
   derive the statistical properties of the magnetic elements, several
   simulation runs are performed.
   Results. Our model is able to produce kG magnetic fields in a time
   interval of the order of the granulation timescale. The mean unsigned
   flux density and the mean magnetic energy density of the synthetic
   quiet Sun reach values of < B > similar or equal to 100 G and < B-2
   >(1/2) similar or equal to 350 G respectively in the stationary regime.
   The derived probability density function of the magnetic field strength
   decreases rapidly from B = 30 G to B similar to 100 G and has a
   secondary maximum at B = 2 kG. From this result, it follows that
   magnetic fields >= 700 G dominate the unsigned flux density and
   magnetic energy density, although the probability density function of
   the field strength reaches a maximum at B similar to 10 G.
   Conclusions. A photospheric advection field with spatio-temporal
   correlations, driving the magnetic elements, and reduced magnetic
   amplification rules are able to create a realistic probability density
   function of the quiet Sun magnetic field. It has been found that they
   naturally produce an excess of magnetic fields around 2 kG if an upper
   limit is imposed on the field strength.}},

   bias of about 0.2 km s(-1) toward the network boundary. Elements of
   negative polarity show a higher bias than elements of positive
   polarity, perhaps as a result of the dominant positive polarity of the
   network in the field of view or because of increased mobility due to
   their smaller size. A preference for motions in X is likely explained
   by higher supergranular flow in that direction. We search for emerging

Abstract = {{Observations in polarized emission reveal the existence of large-scale
   coherent magnetic fields in a wide range of spiral galaxies.
   Radio-polarization data show that these fields are strongly inclined
   towards the radial direction, with pitch angles up to 35 degrees and
   thus cannot be explained by differential rotation alone. Global dynamo
   models describe the generation of the radial magnetic field from the
   underlying turbulence via the so called a-effect. However, these global
   models still rely on crude assumptions about the small-scale
   turbulence. To overcome these restrictions we perform fully dynamical
   MHD simulations of interstellar turbulence driven by supernova
   explosions. From our simulations we extract profiles of the
   contributing diagonal elements of the dynamo alpha-tensor as functions
   of galactic height. We also measure the coefficients describing
   vertical pumping and find that the ratio between these two effects has
   been overestimated in earlier analytical work, where dynamo action
   seemed impossible. In contradiction to these models based on isolated
   remnants we always find the pumping to be directed inward. In addition
   we observe that depends on whether clustering in terms of super-bubbles

   equation. In the second step, a latitudinal pumping term was included
   and then, a near-surface shear was included.
   Results. The results reveal the importance of the pumping mechanism in
   solving current limitations in mean field dynamo modeling, such as the
   storage of the magnetic flux and the latitudinal distribution of the
   sunspots. If a meridional flow is assumed to be present only in the
   upper part of the convective zone, it is the full turbulent pumping
   that regulates both the period of the solar cycle and the latitudinal
   distribution of the sunspot activity. In models that consider shear
   near the surface, a second shell of toroidal field is generated above r
   = 0.95 R-circle dot at all latitudes. If the full pumping is also
   included, the polar toroidal fields are efficiently advected inwards,
   and the toroidal magnetic activity survives only at the observed
   latitudes near the equator. With regard to the parity of the magnetic
   field, only models that combine turbulent pumping with near-surface
   shear always converge to the dipolar parity.
   Conclusions. This result suggests that, under the Babcock-Leighton
   approach, the equartorward motion of the observed magnetic activity is
   governed by the latitudinal pumping of the toroidal magnetic field
   rather than by a large scale coherent meridional flow. Our results
   support the idea that the parity problem is related to the quadrupolar
   imprint of the meridional flow on the poloidal component of the
   magnetic field and the turbulent pumping positively contributes to wash
   out this imprint.}},

Abstract = {{Context. Numerical simulations of magneto-convection and analysis of
   solar magnetograms provide probability distribution functions (PDFs)
   for the magnetic field strength.
   Aims. In the paper, we explore the effects of these PDFs on Zeeman line
   formation.
   Methods. We calculate the mean Stokes parameters for a Milne-Eddington
   atmosphere in the limit of optically thin (micro-turbulent) and thick
   (macro-turbulent) magnetic structures and also the dispersion around
   the mean profiles in the optically thick limit. Several types of PDFs
   are considered: (a) Voigt function and stretched exponential type PDFs
   for fields with fixed direction but fluctuating strength; (b) a
   cylindrically symmetrical power law for the angular distribution of
   magnetic fields with given field strength; ( c) composite PDFs
   accounting for randomness in both strength and direction obtained by
   combining a Voigt function or a stretched exponential with an angular
   power law. For optically thin structures, explicit expressions are
   given for the mean values of the Zeeman absorption matrix elements. We
   also describe how the averaging technique for a normal Zeeman triplet
   may be generalized to the more common case of anomalous Zeeman
   splitting patterns.
   Results. We show that, for magnetic field rms fluctuations of the order
   of 6G, consistent with observational data, Stokes I is essentially
   independent of the shapes of the PDFs but Stokes Q, U, and V and also
   the dispersion around the mean values are quite sensitive to the tail
   behavior of the PDF. We confirm a previous result that Stokes V is less
   sensitive to the scale of the magnetic structures than Stokes Q and U.
   The composite PDF proposed for the fluctuations of the magnetic field
   vector has an angular distribution peaked about the vertical direction
   for strong fields, and is isotropically distributed for weak fields; it
   can be used to mimic solar surface random fields.}},

Abstract = {{Kilogauss-strength magnetic fields are often observed in intergranular
   lanes at the photosphere in the quiet Sun. Such fields are stronger
   than the equipartition field B-e, corresponding to a magnetic energy
   density that matches the kinetic energy density of photospheric
   convection, and comparable with the field B-p that exerts a magnetic
   pressure equal to the ambient gas pressure. We present an idealized
   numerical model of three-dimensional compressible magnetoconvection at
   the photosphere, for a range of values of the magnetic Reynolds number.
   In the absence of a magnetic field, the convection is highly
   supercritical and characterized by a pattern of vigorous,
   time-dependent, `granular' motions. When a weak magnetic field is
   imposed upon the convection, magnetic flux is swept into the convective
   downflows where it forms localized concentrations. Unless this process
   is significantly inhibited by magnetic diffusion, the resulting fields
   are often much greater than B-e and the high magnetic pressure in these
   flux elements leads to their being partially evacuated. Some of these
   flux elements contains ultraintense magnetic fields that are
   significantly greater than B-p. Such fields are contained by a
   combination of the thermal pressure of the gas and the dynamic pressure
   of the convective motion, and they are constantly evolving. These
   ultraintense fields develop owing to non-linear interactions between
   magnetic fields and convection; they cannot be explained in terms of
   `convective collapse' within a thin flux tube that remains in overall
   pressure equilibrium with its surroundings.}},

Abstract = {{Recent observations by the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) on board
   Hinode have revealed that the surface of the Sun is, on average,
   covered with small-scale horizontal magnetic fields. Frequent emergence
   of horizontal magnetic flux on a granular scale is found in the quiet
   Sun and in plage regions. In this Letter we present the results of
   magnetohydrodynamic simulations that cover the upper convection zone
   and the corona. It is found that, even when the initial magnetic field
   is uniform and vertical, a disordered magnetic field is produced in the
   convection zone. The photospheric magnetic field is then characterized
   by strong vertical fields concentrated in the intergranular lanes and
   relatively weak, horizontal fields both in the granules and in the
   intergranular lanes. Occasionally, fragments with large magnetic fluxes
   are driven above the photosphere by the upward convective flows. These
   characteristics are consistent with the SOT observations. Moreover, the
   simulated flux emerging on a granular scale undergoes magnetic
   reconnection with the expanding vertical magnetic concentrations in the
   chromosphere. These reconnection events heat the local plasma and emit
   high-frequency waves that propagate into the corona. Such an interplay
   between the small-scale horizontal fields and the vertical flux may

   Methods. We solve evolution equations for magnetic fields that give the

   fields with various wavenumbers. Both an imposed fully helical steady
   flow consisting of a pattern of screw-like motions (Roberts flow) and

Abstract = {{We discuss a numerical 3D radiation-MHD simulation of penumbral fine
   structure in a small sunspot. This simulation shows the development of
   short filamentary structures with horizontal flows, similar to observed
   Evershed flows, and an inward propagation of these structures at a
   speed compatible with observations. Although the lengths of these
   filaments are much shorter than observed, we conjecture that this

   filament formation and Evershed flows in penumbrae. We conclude that
   the Evershed flow represents the horizontal-flow component of
   overturning convection in gaps with strongly reduced field strength.
   The top of the flow is always directed outward - away from the umbra -
   because of the broken symmetry due to the inclined magnetic field.
   Upflows occur in the inner parts of the gaps and most of the gas turns
   over radially ( outward and sideways), and descends back down again.
   The ascending, cooling, and overturning flow tends to bend magnetic
   field lines down, forcing a weakening of the field that makes it easier
   for gas located in an adjacent layer - farther in - to initiate a
   similar sequence of motion, aided by lateral heating, thus causing the

   Results. The circular polarization maps derived from the observed Fe I
   630 nm lines show clear magnetic signals emerging at the center of
   granular cells. We do not find any evidence for linear polarization
   signals associated with these events. The magnetic flux patches grow
   with time, occupying a significant fraction of the granular area. The
   signals then fade until they disappear completely. The typical lifetime

   synthesized Stokes spectra and the underlying stratification of
   atmospheric parameters like temperature, line-of-sight (LOS) velocity

Abstract = {{The Howard \& Krishnamurti (1986) low-order model (LOM) of

   extended to incorporate various additional physical effects, such as
   externally forced vertical shear and magnetic field. Designing such
   extended LOMs so that their mathematical structure is isomorphic to
   those of systems of coupled gyrostats, with damping and forcing, allows
   for a modular approach while respecting conservation laws. Energy
   conservation (in the limit of no damping and forcing) prevents
   solutions that diverge to infinity, which are present in the original
   Howard \& Krishnamurti LOM. The first LOM developed here (as a
   candidate model of transverse rolls) involves adding a new Couette mode
   to represent externally forced vertical shear. The second LOM is a
   modification of the Lantz (1995) model for magnetoconvection with
   shear. The modification eliminates an invariant manifold in the
   original model that leads to potentially unphysical behavior, namely
   solutions that diverge to infinity, in violation of energy
   conservation. This paper reports the first extension of the coupled
   gyrostats modeling framework to incorporate externally forced vertical
   shear and magnetoconvection with shear. Its aim is to demonstrate
   better model building techniques that avoid pathologies present in

   short compared to the magnetic diffusion time. The numerical study is

   time-scale the dimensionless number appropriate to compare the rotation
   and magnetic forces is independent of the magnetic diffusivity in
   contrast with the often used Elsasser number. Extension of the analysis

Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Although there is considerable evidence supporting an ubiquitous
   magnetic field insolar/ stellar photospheres, its impact in the
   determination of abundances has never been quantified. In this work we
   investigate whether the magnetic field plays a measurable role for this
   kind of study. To that end, we carry out simulations of spectral line
   formation in the presence of a magnetic field and then use those
   profiles to derive the abundance of several atomic species ( Fe, Si, C,
   and O), neglecting the magnetic field. In this way, we find that the
   derived iron abundance can be significantly biased, with systematic
   errors of up to 0.1 dex. In the case of silicon, carbon, and oxygen,
   their role is very marginal ( errors smaller than 0.02 dex). We also
   find that the effect of the magnetic field strongly depends on its
   inclination with respect to the observer. We show that fields that are
   aligned with the observer lead to an underestimation of the real
   abundance, whereas more inclined ones overestimate it. In the case of a
   mixture of fields with different inclinations, these effects are likely
   to partly cancel each other out, making the role of the magnetic field
   even less important. Finally, we derive a simple model that can be used
   to determine the suitability of a spectral line when we wish to avoid
   the bias introduced by the neglect of the magnetic field.}},

Abstract = {{Aims. Magnetic elements are thought to be described by flux tube
   models, and are well reproduced by MHD simulations. However, these
   simulations are only partially constrained by observations. We
   observationally investigate the relationship between G-band bright
   points and magnetic structures to clarify conditions, which make
   magnetic structures bright in G-band.
   Methods. The G-band filtergrams together with magnetograms and
   dopplergrams were taken for a plage region covered by abnormal granules
   as well as ubiquitous G-band bright points, using the Swedish 1-m Solar
   Telescope (SST) under very good seeing conditions.
   Results. High magnetic flux density regions are not necessarily
   associated with G-band bright points. We refer to the observed extended
   areas with high magnetic flux density as magnetic islands to separate
   them from magnetic elements. We discover that G-band bright points tend
   to be located near the boundary of such magnetic islands. The
   concentration of G-band bright points decreases with inward distance
   from the boundary of the magnetic islands. Moreover, G-band bright
   points are preferentially located where magnetic flux density is
   higher, given the same distance from the boundary. There are some
   bright points located far inside the magnetic islands. Such bright
   points have higher minimum magnetic flux density at the larger inward
   distance from the boundary. Convective velocity is apparently reduced
   for such high magnetic flux density regions regardless of whether they
   are populated by G-band bright points or not. The magnetic islands are
   surrounded by downflows.
   Conclusions. These results suggest that high magnetic flux density, as
   well as efficient heat transport from the sides or beneath, are
   required to make magnetic elements bright in G-band.}},

Abstract = {{Mean-field theory describes magnetohydrodynamic processes leading to
   large-scale magnetic fields in various cosmic objects. In this study
   magnetoconvection and dynamo processes in a rotating spherical shell
   are considered. Mean fields are defined by azimuthal averaging. In the
   framework of mean-field theory, the coefficients which determine the
   traditional representation of the mean electromotive force, including
   derivatives of the mean magnetic field up to the first order, are
   crucial for analyzing and simulating dynamo action. Two methods are
   developed to extract mean-field coefficients from direct numerical
   simulations of the mentioned processes. While the first method does not
   use intrinsic approximations, the second one is based oil the
   second-order correlation approximation. There is satisfying agreement
   of the results of both methods for sufficiently slow fluid motions.
   Both methods are applied to simulations of rotating magnetoconvection
   and a quasi-stationary geodynamo. The mean-field induction effects
   described by these coefficients, e.g., the alpha-effect, are highly
   anisotropic in both examples. An alpha(2)-mechanism is suggested along
   with a strong gamma-effect operating Outside the inner core tangent
   cylinder. The turbulent diffusivity exceeds the molecular one by at
   least one order or magnitude in the geodynarno example. With the aim to
   compare mean-field simulations with corresponding direct numerical
   simulations, a two-dimensional mean-field model involving all
   previously determined mean-field coefficients was constructed. Various
   tests with different sets of mean-field coefficients reveal their
   action and significance. In the magnetoconvection and geodynarno
   examples considered here, the match between direct numerical
   simulations and mean-field simulations is only satisfying if a large
   number of mean-field coefficients are involved. In the
   magnetoconvection example, the azimuthally averaged magnetic field
   resulting from the numerical simulation is in good agreement with its
   counterpart in the mean-field model. However, this match is not
   completely satisfactory in the geodynarno case anymore. Here the
   traditional representation of the mean electromotive force ignoring
   higher than first-order spatial derivatives of the mean magnetic field
   is no longer a good approximation.}},

   Cluster analysis of Stokes V profile pairs shows that the two lines,

   shapes. In the network, the local magnetic topology is more important
   in determining the shapes of the Stokes V profiles than the phase of
   the wave, contrary to what our simulations show. We also find that
   Stokes V asymmetries are very common in the network, and the histograms
   of the observed amplitude and area asymmetries differ significantly
   from the simulation. Both the network and internetwork show oscillatory
   behavior in the Ca II lines. It is stronger in the network, where
   shocking waves, similar to those in the high-beta simulation, are seen

Abstract = {{In dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal conduction is primarily along
   magnetic field lines, and therefore highly anisotropic. As a result,
   the usual convective stability criterion is modified from a condition
   on entropy to a condition on temperature. For small magnetic fields or
   small wavenumbers, instability occurs in any atmosphere where the
   temperature and pressure gradients point in the same direction. We
   refer to the resulting convective instability as the magnetothermal
   instability (MTI). We present fully three-dimensional simulations of
   the MTI and show that saturation results in an atmosphere with
   different vertical structure, dependent on the boundary conditions.
   When the temperature at the boundary of the unstable layer is allowed
   to vary, the temperature gradient relaxes until the unstable region is
   almost isothermal. When the temperature at the boundary of the unstable
   region is fixed, the magnetic field is reoriented to an almost vertical
   geometry as a result of buoyant motions. This case exhibits more
   vigorous turbulence. In both cases the resulting saturated heat flux is
   almost one-half of the value expected if the conduction were purely
   isotropic, Q similar to chi Delta T/L, where chi is the thermal
   conductivity, Delta T is the fixed temperature drop across the
   simulation domain, and L is the temperature gradient scale length. The
   action of the MTI results in dynamical processes that lead to
   significant transport perpendicular to the initial direction of
   themagnetic field. The resulting magnetoconvection in both cases
   amplifies the magnetic field until it is almost in equipartition with
   sustained subsonic turbulence. These results are relevant to
   understanding measurements of the temperature profiles of the
   intracluster medium of clusters of galaxies as well as the structure of
   radiatively inefficient accretion flows.}},

Abstract = {{The potentiostatic electrodeposition of Co, Ni and Cu in external
   homogenous magnetic fields up to B = 1 T, differently aligned to the

   strength of the gradient forces depends on the paramagnetic
   susceptibility of the metal ions, the concentration gradient inside the
   diffusion layer, and the strength and gradient of the magnetic field.
   For the deposition of Cu the highest gradient force acts at the
   beginning of the deposition process and drops down after some seconds
   to a negligible value although the magnetic susceptibility is lower in
   comparison to Ni and Co. But no hydrogen reaction takes place. For the
   deposition of Co the gradient force is low at the beginning due to the
   dominating hydrogen evolution reaction and reaches its maximum after a
   deposition time of about 10 s. The deposition of Ni is mixed-controlled
   and superimposed by the hydrogen evolution reaction. The effect of the
   gradient force on the deposition behaviour is small. It has been shown
   that the gradient force acts in the vicinity of the electrode surface

Abstract = {{Thermal magnetoconvection in a rapidly rotating spherical shell is
   investigated numerically and experimentally in electrically conductive
   liquid gallium (Prandtl number P = 0.025), at Rayleigh numbers R up to
   around 6 times critical and at Ekman numbers E similar to 10(-6). This
   work follows up the non-magnetic study of convection presented in a
   companion paper (Gillet et al. 2007). We study here the addition of a
   z-invariant toroidal magnetic field to the fluid flow. The experimental
   measurements of fluid velocities by ultrasonic Doppler velocimetry,
   together with the quasi-geostrophic numerical simulations incorporating
   a three-dimensional modelling of the magnetic induction processes,
   demonstrate a stabilizing effect of the magnetic field in the
   weak-field case, characterized by an Elsasser number Lambda <

   critical parameters at the onset of convection as A increases. As in
   the non-magnetic study, strong zonal jets of characteristic length
   scales l(beta) (Rhines length scale) dominates the fluid dynamics. A
   new characteristic of the magnetoconvective flow is the elongation of
   the convective cells in the direction of the imposed magnetic field,
   introducing a new length scale to. Combining experimental and numerical

   in which the real driving coefficient lambda(x) is either constant or
   the quadratic lambda(0) - gamma(2)(epsilon)x(2). This CGL equation
   arises in the weakly nonlinear theory of spherical Couette flow between
   two concentric spheres caused by rotating them both about a common axis
   with distinct angular velocities in the narrow gap (aspect ratio
   epsilon) limit. Roughly square Taylor vortices are confined near the
   equator, where their amplitude modulation a (x, t) varies with a
   suitably `stretched' latitude x. The value of empty set(epsilon), which
   depends oil sphere angular velocity ratio, generally tends to zero with
   epsilon. Though we report new solutions for empty set(epsilon not
   equal) 0, our main focus is the physically more interesting limit empty
   set(epsilon) = 0.
   When lambda = constant, uniformly bounded solutions of our CGL equation
   on -infinity < x < infinity have some remarkable related features,
   which occur at all values of lambda. Firstly, the linearised equation
   has no non-trivial neutral modes a(x) exp(i ohm t) with any real

   expressed in terms of the single complex amplitude a(x), which is
   locilised as a pulse on the length scale L-PS = 20 about x = 0. Each
   pulseamplitude a(x - x(n)) exp(i phi(n)) is identical up to the phase
   phi(n) = (-1)(n)pi/4, is centred at x(n) = (n + 1/2)L-PS and oscillates
   at frequency (2(n) + 1)ohm. The survival of the pulse-train depends
   upon the nonlinear mutual interaction of close neighbours;
   self'-interaction is inadequate, as the absence of steady solutions
   shows. For given constant values of, in excess of some threshold
   lambda(MIN) (> 0), solutions with pulse-separation L-PS were located on
   a finite range L-min(lambda) <= L-PS <= L-max(lambda).
   Here, we seek new pulse-train solutions, for which the product a (x, t)
   exp(-ixt) is spatially periodic on the length 2L = NLPS, N is an
   element of N. The BS-mode at small lambda has N = 2, and on increasing
   lambda it bifurcates to another symmetry-broken N = 2 solution. Other
   bifurcations to N = 6 were located. Solution branches with N odd,
   namely 3, 5, 7, were only found after solving initial value problems.
   Many of the large amplitude solutions are stable. Generally, the
   BS-mode is preferred at moderate lambda, while that preference yields
   to the other symmetry-broken N = 2 solution at larger lambda.
   Quasi-periodic solutions are also common. We conclude that finite
   amplitude solutions, not necessarily of BS-form, are robust in the

Abstract = {{We discuss the posteruptive evolution of a `` coronal dimming'' based

   Observatory and the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer ( TRACE).
   This discussion highlights the roles played by magnetoconvection-
   driven magnetic reconnection and the global magnetic environment of the
   plasma in the `` filling'' and apparent motion of the region following
   the eruption of a coronal mass ejection ( CME). A crucial element in
   our understanding of the dimming region's evolution is developed by
   monitoring the disappearance and reappearance of bright TRACE `` moss''
   around the active region that gives rise to the CME. We interpret the
   change in the TRACE moss as a proxy of the changing coronal magnetic
   field topology behind the CME front. We infer that the change in the
   global magnetic topology also results in a shift of the energy balance
   in the process responsible for the production of the moss emission
   while the coronal magnetic topology evolves from closed to open and
   back to closed again because, following the eruption, the moss reforms
   around the active region in almost exactly its pre-event configuration.
   As a result of the moss's evolution, combining our discussion with
   recent spectroscopic results of an equatorial coronal hole, we suggest
   that the interchangeable use of the term ``transient coronal hole'' to
   describe a coronal dimming is more than just a simple coincidence.}},

Abstract = {{Recent progress in realistic simulations of solar convection have given
   us an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate the robustness of solar
   interior structures and dynamics obtained by methods of local
   helioseismology. We present results of testing the time-distance method
   using realistic simulations. By computing acoustic wave propagation
   time and distance relations for different depths of the simulated data,
   we confirm that acoustic waves propagate into the interior and then
   turn back to the photosphere. This demonstrates that in numerical
   simulations properties of acoustic waves (p-modes) are similar to the
   solar conditions, and that these properties can be analyzed by the
   time-distance technique. For surface gravity waves (f-modes), we
   calculate perturbations of their travel times caused by localized
   downdrafts and demonstrate that the spatial pattern of these
   perturbations ( representing so-called sensitivity kernels) is similar
   to the patterns obtained from the real Sun, displaying characteristic
   hyperbolic structures. We then test time-distance measurements and
   inversions by calculating acoustic travel times from a sequence of
   vertical velocities at the photosphere of the simulated data and
   inferring mean three-dimensional flow fields by performing inversion
   based on the ray approximation. The inverted horizontal flow fields
   agree very well with the simulated data in subsurface areas up to 3 Mm
   deep, but differ in deeper areas. Due to the cross talk effects between
   the horizontal divergence and downward flows, the inverted vertical
   velocities are significantly different from the mean convection
   velocities of the simulation data set. These initial tests provide
   important validation of time-distance helioseismology measurements of
   supergranular-scale convection, illustrate limitations of this

Abstract = {{The results of the determination of magnetic field strength from weak
   polarimetric signals in solar internetwork regions are contradictory.
   We investigate the origin of this contradiction with the help of MHD
   simulations. It is shown that the Stokes V amplitude ratio of the Fe i
   lambda lambda 15652-15648 lines is a good indicator of kG magnetic
   field concentrations, even for magnetic fields with a complex internal
   structure like those in MHD simulations. The Stokes V amplitude ratio
   of the Fe i lambda lambda 5247-5250 lines also shows a good correlation
   with magnetic field strength. However, in simulations with a flux level
   appropriate for the internetwork, it gives values corresponding to
   sub-kG fields. The reason is the rapid decrease of the field strength
   with height in kG magnetic field concentrations. These lines sample
   high regions of the atmosphere, where the field is already below kG
   levels. We also find that the Stokes V amplitude ratio of the Fe i
   lambda lambda 6301-6302 lines shows no correlation with the magnetic
   field strength. The reason lies in the large difference in the heights
   of formation of these two lines. The value of the magnetic field
   strength obtained from the Fe i lambda lambda 6301 and 6302 lines
   depends crucially on the treatment of gradients of the magnetic field,
   line-of-sight velocity, and temperature, even at a numerical spatial
   resolution of 20 km.}},

Abstract = {{An analysis is made of the linear stability of wide-gap hydromagnetic
   (MHD) dissipative Couette flow of an incompressible electrically
   conducting fluid between two rotating concentric circular cylinders in
   the presence of a uniform axial magnetic field. A constant heat flux is
   applied at the outer cylinder and the inner cylinder is kept at a
   constant temperature. Both types of boundary conditions viz; perfectly
   electrically conducting and electrically nonconducting walls are
   examined. The three cases of mu < 0 (counterrotating), mu > 0
   (co-rotating), and mu=0 (stationary outer cylinder) are considered.
   Assuming very small magnetic Prandtl number P-m, the wide-gap
   perturbation equations are derived and solved by a direct numerical
   procedure. It is found that for given values of the radius ratio eta
   and the heat flux parameter N, the critical Taylor number T-c at the
   onset of instability increases with increase in Hartmann number Q for
   both conducting and nonconducting walls thus establishing the
   stabilizing influence of the magnetic field. Further it is found that
   insulating walls are more destabilizing than the conducting walls. It
   is observed that for given values of eta and Q, the critical Taylor
   number T-c decreases with increase in N. The analysis further reveals
   that for mu = 0 and perfectly conducting walls, the critical wave
   number a(c) is not a monotonic function of Q but first increases,
   reaches a maximum and then decreases with further increase in Q. It is
   also observed that while a(c) is a monotonic decreasing function of A
   for N=0, in the presence of heat flux (N=1), a(c) has a maximum at a
   negative value of mu (counter-rotating cylinders).}},

Abstract = {{Context. The recent discovery of dark-cored penumbral filaments
   suggests that we are resolving the building blocks of sunspot
   penumbrae. Their properties are largely unknown but provide important
   clues to understanding penumbral fine structure.
   Aims. Our observations provide new constraints for the different
   scenarios put forward to explain the structure of sunspot penumbrae.
   Methods. We present an analysis of dark-cored penumbral filaments,
   based on intensity filtergrams (G-band, continuum and Ca II H line
   wing), magnetograms and Dopplergrams, obtained at heliocentric
   distances between 15 degrees and 55 degrees.
   Results. In general, the visibility of dark cores degrades with
   increasing heliocentric distance. Based on Ca II H wing images we
   conclude that this is due to a geometrical 3D-effect and not due to a
   simple formation height effect. Only in the center-side penumbra are
   dark-cored filaments visible at all observed heliocentric distances. We
   observe that dark-cored filaments frequently split in the umbra,
   forming a Y-shape that disappears after a few minutes, leaving a
   shortened filamentary structure and a bright dot in the umbra. The
   dark-cored filaments have life times >= 90 min. The dark cores are
   related to a much weaker and a more horizontal magnetic field than
   their lateral brightenings. Where the dark-cored filaments appear in
   the umbra, the magnetic field is inclined by 40. with respect to the
   solar surface normal for both the dark core and the bright edges. With
   increasing distance from the umbra, the magnetic field inclination in
   the dark cores increases rapidly within a few thousand km. Both the
   magnetic field strength and inclination in the lateral brightenings
   show very small variations with spot-center radial distance. The
   velocity field possesses a strong horizontal component within the dark
   cores. The absolute line-of-sight (LOS) velocity is larger within the
   dark cores than in their lateral brightenings. The Evershed flow
   apparently is present primarily in the dark cores.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical results on thermally driven nonlinear magnetoconvection in a
   rapidly rotating fluid spherical shell are reported. A uniform magnetic
   field that is parallel to the rotation axis is imposed externally. The
   Ekman number is 2 x 10(-6), representing a state of negligible
   viscosity, as in the Earth's core. The convection pattern is
   characterized by a few large-scale vortex columns superimposed on a
   fast westward (retrograde) zonal flow. In the equatorial region, an
   anticyclonic vortex is intensified, in which an induced axial magnetic
   field is stored. Interaction between the magnetized vortex and the
   zonal flow leads to a thin Jet at the western side of the vortex. The
   jet is also characterized by a thin electric current sheet caused by a
   steep gradient of the axial magnetic field. Because of this structure,
   the jet region can be designated as a magnetic front by analogy with
   fronts in mid-latitude atmospheric cyclones. It can be estimated from
   an order-of-magnitude analysis that the jet width decreases in inverse
   proportion to the zonal flow speed, and that the jet speed and the
   sheet-like electric current are proportional to the square of the zonal
   flow speed.}},

   These three basic ingredients provide PDFs in good agreement with the
   PDFs produced by realistic numerical simulations of magnetoconvection,

   particular, the distribution is approximately lognormal, and it
   produces an excess of magnetic fields (i.e., a hump in the
   distribution) right before the maximum field strength. The success of
   this simple model may indicate that only a few basic ingredients shape
   the quiet-Sun PDF. Our approach provides a concise parametric

   magnetic field in which they are observed. The signature of the
   fluctuations (in space and time) is consistent with their creation by
   magnetoconvection-forced reconnection, which is driven by the flow
   field in the high-beta plasma. The signature of the intensity
   fluctuations around an active region suggests that the bulk of the mass

Abstract = {{Aims. We use spectro-polarimetric THEMIS/MSDP data to investigate the
   3D structure of solar magnetic-flux tubes across the upper photosphere.
   Methods. Profiles of the sodium D-1 line 589.6 nm are analysed by the
   bisector method at different wavelengths from the core to the wings,
   for several bright features. They are compared to synthetic profiles
   derived from 2D magnetic models of flux tubes and from the MULTI code
   for NLTE line profiles. Three different magnetic models of flux tubes
   are investigated. Model (I) consists of a single flux tube that
   compensates for the horizontal Lorentz forces exactly, while model (II)
   uses a compromise between horizontal and vertical components. Model
   (III), a conglomerate of thinner flux tubes, leads to the best
   agreement with observations.
   Results. (1) The combination of seeing effects (small filling factor)
   with slopes of line profiles, which are different in the flux tubes and
   the neighbouring quiet sun, account for the decrease in observed
   magnetic field from line core to line wings in central parts of
   magnetic features, as well as the decrease in magnetic fluxes
   integrated over the whole magnetic features. (2) The expansion with
   height of single magnetic flux tubes (models I and II) accounts for the
   increase in the size of magnetic features from line wings to line core.
   (3) Pure thermodynamical criteria characterising Dopplershifts and
   line-intensity fluctuations of magnetic and non-magnetic features have
   been proven by observations.
   Conclusions. We could account for differential Zeeman effects along the
   D-1 line profile by combining expansion of flux tubes with height, low
   gas pressure inside flux tubes, and small filling factor due to seeing
   effects. Better agreement with observations, in particular with respect
   to magnetic field amplitudes, will probably need 3D models that take
   velocity fields and horizontal gradients of temperature into account.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional Boussinesq magnetoconvection with idealized stress-free

Abstract = {{Aims. We promote the use of narrow-band (0.05-0.20 nm FWHM) imaging in

   with exceptionally high contrast.
   Methods. We create synthetic narrow-band CN filtergrams from spectra
   computed from a three-dimensional snapshot of a magnetohydrodynamic
   simulation of the solar convection to illustrate the expected high
   contrast and explain its nature. In addition, we performed observations
   with the horizontal slit spectrograph at the Dunn Solar Tower at 388.3
   nm to experimentally confirm the high bright-point contrast, and to
   characterize and optimize the transmission profile of a narrow-band
   (0.04 FWHM) Lyot filter, which was built by Lyot and tailored to the CN
   band at Sacramento Peak in the early 70's.
   Results. The presented theoretical computations predict that
   bright-point contrast in narrow-band (0.04 FWHM) CN filtergrams is more
   than 3 times higher than in CN filtergrams taken with 1 nm FWHM wide
   filters, and in typical G-band filtergrams. Images taken through the

Abstract = {{Aims. We study the structure and reveal the physical nature of the

   3-dimensional radiative hydrodynamics simulations.
   Methods. We used the MURaM code to obtain a realistic model of the
   near-surface layers of the convection zone and the photosphere.
   Results. The pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations at the base
   of the photosphere consists of relatively hot granular cells bounded by
   the cooler intergranular downflow network. With increasing height in
   the photosphere, the amplitude of the temperature fluctuations
   diminishes. At a height of z = 130 - 140 km in the photosphere, the
   pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations reverses so that
   granular regions become relatively cool compared to the intergranular
   network. Detailed analysis of the trajectories of fluid elements
   through the photosphere reveal that the motion of the fluid is
   non-adiabatic, owing to strong radiative cooling when approaching the
   surface of optical depth unity followed by reheating by the radiation
   field from below. The temperature structure of the photosphere results
   from the competition between expansion of rising fluid elements and
   radiative heating. The former acts to lower the temperature of the
   fluid whereas the latter acts to increase it towards the radiative
   equilibrium temperature with a net entropy gain. After the fluid
   overturns and descends towards the convection zone, radiative energy
   loss again decreases the entropy of the fluid. Radiative heating and
   cooling of fluid elements that penetrate into the photosphere and
   overturn do not occur in equal amounts. The imbalance in the cumulative
   heating and cooling of these fluid elements is responsible for the
   reversal of temperature fluctuations with respect to height in the

   cyclonic. When the Lorentz forces are strong enough, we find
   anticyclonic thermal winds as observed in the Earth's polar region from
   secular variation data. Under strong thermal convection, the azimuthal
   flow is created by the magnetic mode with one or more coherent, strong
   upwellings inside the tangent cylinder (TC), offset from the polar
   axis. We also find that, as the convection in the TC becomes stronger,
   these vortex plumes shrink in size, consistent with the convection
   being controlled by the magnetic field. In addition, strong upwellings
   in the TC could expel magnetic field in its path, creating regions of
   weak or even reverse flux patches. These patches drift westward, but at
   a significantly slower angular speed than the rotation about the vortex
   itself. Calculations with electrically conducting and stress-free

   winds is fairly independent of the boundary conditions imposed,
   provided the Rayleigh number is high enough to excite the magnetic mode.}},

Abstract = {{Results from kinematic solar dynamo models employing alpha-effect and
   turbulent pumping from local convection calculations are presented. We
   estimate the magnitude of these effects to be around 2-3 ms(-1), having
   scaled the local quantities with the convective velocity at the bottom
   of the convection zone from a solar mixing-length model. Rotation
   profile of the Sun as obtained from helioseismology is applied in the
   models; we also investigate the effects of the observed surface shear
   layer on the dynamo solutions. With these choices of the small- and
   large-scale velocity fields, we obtain estimate, 10(-3), of the ratio
   of the two induction effects, C-alpha/C-Omega approximate to 10(-3),
   which we keep fixed in all models. We also include a one-cell
   meridional circulation pattern having a magnitude of 10-20 ms(-1) near
   the surface and 1-2 ms(-1) at the bottom of the convection zone. The
   model essentially represents a distributed turbulent dynamo, as the
   alpha-effect is nonzero throughout the convection zone, although it
   concentrates near the bottom of the convection zone obtaining a maximum
   around 30 degrees of latitude. Turbulent pumping of the mean fields is
   predominantly down- and equatorward. The anisotropies in the turbulent
   diffusivity are neglected apart from the fact that the diffusivity is
   significantly reduced in the overshoot region. We find that, when all
   these effects are included in the model, it is possible to correctly
   reproduce many features of the solar activity cycle, namely the correct
   equatorward migration at low latitudes and the polar branch at high
   latitudes, and the observed negative sign of BrB phi. Although the
   activity clearly shifts towards the equator in comparison to previous
   models due to the combined action of the alpha-effect peaking at
   midlatitudes, meridional circulation and latitudinal pumping, most of
   the activity still occurs at too high latitudes (between 5 degrees...60
   degrees). Other problems include the relatively narrow parameter space
   within which the preferred solution is dipolar (AO), and the somewhat
   too short cycle lengths of the solar-type solutions. The role of the
   surface shear layer is found to be important only in the case where the
   alpha-effect has an appreciable magnitude near the surface. (c) 2006

Abstract = {{To reconcile discrepancies in the observed contrast of magnetic flux

   magnetoconvection models in four different passbands: two continuum
   bands, at 1626 and 575 nm, the G band, and the line wing of the Ca II K
   line. Magnetic flux concentrations are selected by their G-band
   brightness. In the near-infrared the selected flux concentrations
   appear inconspicuous with intensities that are on average below that of
   the synthetic average quiet Sun, while their contrast in the visible
   passband is mostly positive. When we account for limited telescope
   resolution and imperfect seeing, the contrasts of bright points in the
   visible become increasingly negative as a result of mixing with the
   dark intergranular lanes in which they are embedded. The correlation in
   bright-point intensity between different passbands becomes increasingly
   poor from the G band to the visible and the near-infrared. This is
   caused in part by the varying amount of spectral lines in each of the
   bands. Further, we find that the largest magnetic field concentrations,
   representative of micropores or magnetic knots, are dark in all four
   passbands. The brightenings in the Ca II K line wing do not coincide
   with magnetic flux concentrations on the spatial scale of the
   simulation. Finally, we find that the rms intensity contrast in all

Abstract = {{Most probably the sunspot cycle period is ruled by a meridional flow

   the other hand, if the eddy diffusivity is low enough, dramatic
   modification of the standard alpha(2) Omega-dynamo by the meridional

   periods, dynamo numbers and the sign of the current helicity as a
   function of the magnetic Reynolds number for a double cell meridional
   circulation and for a positive a-effect at the base of the convection
   zone. The dynamo action occurs at lower latitudes and its location is
   at the interface between equatorward and poleward motions near the base

Abstract = {{Aims. The alpha- and gamma-effects, which are responsible for the
   generation and turbulent pumping of large scale magnetic fields,
   respectively, due to passive advection by convection are determined in
   the rapid rotation regime corresponding to the deep layers of the solar
   convection zone.
   Methods. A 3D rectangular local model is used for solving the full set
   of MHD equations in order to compute the electromotive force (emf),
   epsilon = u x b, generated by the interaction of imposed weak
   gradient-free magnetic fields and turbulent convection with varying
   rotational influence and latitude. By expanding the emf in terms of the
   mean magnetic field, epsilon(i) = a(ij)jB(j), all nine components of
   a(ij) are computed. The diagonal elements of a(ij) describe the
   alpha-effect, whereas the off-diagonals represent magnetic pumping. The
   latter is essentially the advection of magnetic fields by means other
   than the underlying large-scale velocity field. Comparisons are made to
   analytical expressions of the coefficients derived under the
   first-order smoothing approximation (FOSA).
   Results. In the rapid rotation regime the latitudinal dependence of the
   alpha-components responsible for the generation of the azimuthal and
   radial fields does not exhibit a peak at the poles, as is the case for
   slow rotation, but at a latitude of about 30 degrees. The magnetic
   pumping is predominantly radially down- and latitudinally equatorward
   as in earlier studies. The numerical results compare surprisingly well
   with analytical expressions derived under first-order smoothing,
   although the present calculations are expected to lie near the limits
   of the validity range of FOSA.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of magnetic fields with convection is of great
   importance in astrophysics. Two well-known aspects of the interaction
   are the tendency of convection cells to become narrow in the
   perpendicular direction when the imposed field is strong, and the
   occurrence of streaming instabilities involving horizontal shears.
   Previous studies have found that the latter instability mechanism
   operates only when the cells are narrow, and so we investigate the
   occurrence of the streaming instability for large imposed fields, when
   the cells are naturally narrow near onset. The basic cellular solution
   can be treated in the asymptotic limit as a nonlinear eigenvalue
   problem. In the limit of large imposed field, the instability occurs
   for asymptotically small Prandtl number. The determination of the
   stability boundary turns out to be surprisingly complicated. At leading
   order, the linear stability problem is the linearisation of the same
   nonlinear eigenvalue problem, and as a result, it is necessary to go to
   higher order to obtain a stability criterion. We establish that the
   flow can only be unstable to a horizontal mean flow if the Prandtl
   number is smaller than order B-0(-4/3), where B-0 is the imposed
   magnetic field, and that the mean flow is concentrated in a horizontal
   jet of width B-0(-1/6) in the middle of the layer.}},

Abstract = {{A numerical model of idealized sunspots and pores is presented, where
   axisymmetric cylindrical domains are used with aspect ratios (radius
   versus depth) up to 4. The model contains a compressible plasma with
   density and temperature gradients simulating the upper layer of the
   Sun's convection zone. Non-linear magnetohydrodynamic equations are
   solved numerically and time-dependent solutions are obtained where the
   magnetic field is pushed to the centre of the domain by convection
   cells. This central magnetic flux bundle is maintained by an inner
   convection cell, situated next to it and with a flow such that there is
   an inflow at the top of the numerical domain towards the flux bundle.
   For aspect ratio 4, a large inner cell persists in time, but for lower
   aspect ratios it becomes highly time dependent. For aspect ratios 2 and
   3 this inner convection cell is smaller, tends to be situated towards
   the top of the domain next to the flux bundle, and appears and
   disappears with time. When it is gone, the neighbouring cell (with an
   opposite sense of rotation, i.e. outflow at the top) pulls the magnetic
   field away from the central axis. As this happens a new inner cell
   forms with an inflow which pushes the magnetic field towards the
   centre. This suggests that to maintain their form, both pores and
   sunspots need a neighbouring convection cell with inflow at the top
   towards the magnetic flux bundle. This convection cell does not have to
   be at the top of the convection zone and could be underneath the
   penumbral structure around sunspots. For an aspect ratio of 1, there is
   not enough space in the numerical domain for magnetic flux and
   convection to separate. In this case the solution oscillates between
   two steady states: two dominant convection cells threaded by magnetic
   field and one dominant cell that pushes magnetic flux towards the
   central axis.}},

   reversals, bimodal field distribution, and coherence resonance in a
   spherically symmetric mean-field dynamo model. Phys. Rev. Lett. 94
   (2005) 184506] it was shown that a simple mean-field dynamo model with
   a spherically symmetric helical turbulence parameter a can exhibit a
   number of features which are typical for Earth's magnetic field
   reversals. In particular, the model produces asymmetric reversals (with
   a slow decay of the dipole of one polarity and a fast recreation of the
   dipole with opposite polarity), a positive correlation of field
   strength and interval length, and a bimodal field distribution. All
   these features are attributable to the magnetic field dynamics in the
   vicinity of an exceptional point of the spectrum of the non-selfadjoint
   dynamo operator where two real eigenvalues coalesce and continue as a
   complex conjugated pair of eigenvalues. Usually, this exceptional point
   is associated with a nearby local maximum of the growth rate dependence
   on the magnetic Reynolds number. The negative slope of this curve
   between the local maximum and the exceptional point makes the system
   unstable and drives it to the exceptional point and beyond into the
   oscillatory branch where the sign change happens. A weakness of this
   reversal model is the apparent necessity to fine-tune the magnetic
   Reynolds number and/or the radial profile of alpha in order to adjust
   the operator spectrum in an appropriate way. In the present paper, it
   is shown that this fine-tuning is not necessary in the case of higher
   supercriticality of the dynamo. Numerical examples and physical
   arguments are compiled to show that, with increasing magnetic Reynolds
   number, there is strong tendency for the exceptional point and the
   associated local maximum to move close to the zero growth rate line
   where the indicated reversal scenario can be actualized. Although
   exemplified again by the spherically symmetric alpha(2) dynamo model,
   the main idea of this ``self-tuning{''} mechanism of saturated dynamos
   into a reversal-prone state seems well transferable to other dynamos.
   As a consequence, reversing dynamos might be much more typical and may
   occur much more frequently in nature than what could be expected from a
   purely kinematic perspective. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   We use 1D and 2D radiative transfer modeling and 3D solar convection
   and magnetoconvection simulations to reproduce and explain the H alpha
   wing images. We find that the blue H alpha wing obeys near-LTE line
   formation. It appears particularly bright in magnetic elements through
   low temperature gradients. The granulation observed in the blue wing of
   H alpha has low contrast because of the lack of H alpha opacity in the
   upper photosphere, Doppler cancellation, and large opacity sensitivity
   to temperature working against source function sensitivity. We conclude
   that the blue H alpha wing represents a promising proxy magnetometer to
   locate and track isolated intermittent magnetic elements, a better one

   mechanism that causes magnetic flux elements to be particularly bright
   in the CN and CH filtergrams, namely, the partial evacuation of these

Abstract = {{Aims. The Strouhal number (St), which is a nondimensional measure of
   the correlation time, is determined from numerical models of
   convection. The Strouhal number arises in the mean-field theories of
   angular momentum transport and magnetic field generation, where its
   value determines the validity of certain widely used approximations,
   such as the first order smoothing ( hereafter FOSA). More specifically,
   the relevant transport coefficients can be calculated by means of a
   cumulative series expansion if St < St(crit) approximate to 1.
   Methods. We define the Strouhal number as the ratio of the correlation
   and turnover times, which we determine separately, the former from the
   autocorrelation of velocity, and the latter by following test particles
   embedded in the flow.
   Results. We find that the Strouhal numbers are, generally, of the order
   of 0.1 to 0.4 which is close to the critical value above which
   deviations from FOSA become significant. Increasing the rotational
   influence tends to shorten both timescales in such a manner that St
   decreases. However, we do not find a clear trend as a function of the
   Rayleigh number for the parameter range explored in the present study.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of a conserved quantity on an oscillatory pattern-forming

   stability properties of both travelling and standing waves are
   analysed, with particular progress being possible in the limit of
   long-wavelength perturbations. For both forms of waves, the
   corresponding modulational stability boundaries are significantly
   altered by the presence of the conserved quantity; also, new
   instabilities are generated. For general perturbations, the full
   stability regions are found numerically. Simulations of the nonlinear
   governing equations are performed using a pseudo-spectral code; a
   variety of stable attractors are thus found of varying degrees of
   complexity. Previously unseen, highly localized, solutions are observed.}},

   Stars as point sources can be represented by Dirac delta-functions

   deconvolve unresolved images of star fields even at angular distances
   smaller than the diffraction limit of the telescope with which the

   image of two stars with an angular separation of a factor 2.5 less than

   feasible only for point sources. For extended objects the information

   D/lambda = 1/alpha(min) is irretrievably lost. We discuss the

Abstract = {{Small magnetic structures can be seen in G-band filtergrams as isolated
   bright points, strings of bright points and dark micro-pores. At a
   resolution of 0.'' 1, new forms of magnetic structures are found in
   strong field areas: elongated ``ribbons{''} and more circular
   ``flowers{''}. In this paper we study the temporal evolution of these
   small scale magnetic structures. In strong-field regions the
   time-evolution is more that of a magnetic fluid than that of
   collections of flux-tubes that keep their identity. We find that the
   granular flow concentrates the magnetic field into flux sheets that are
   visible as thin bright features in the filtergrams. Weak upflows are
   found in the flux sheets and downflows in the immediate surroundings.
   The flux sheets often become unstable to a fluting instability and the
   edges buckle. The sheets tend to break up into strings of bright
   points, still with weak upflows in themagnetic elements and zero
   velocity or downflows between them. Where there are larger flux
   concentrations we find ribbons, flowers and micro-pores. There is a
   continuous transition between these forms and they evolve from one form
   to another. The appearance is mostly determined by the horizontal size
   - larger structures are dark (micro-pores), narrower structures are
   ribbon shaped and the flowers are the smallest in extent. All these
   structures have darker inner parts and a bright edge. The plasma is
   found to be at rest in the ribbons, with small concentrations of weak
   upflow sites. Narrow sheets with downdrafts are found right at the
   edges of the magnetic field concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Three main mechanisms have been described to determine the maximum
   field strength and structure of a solar or stellar magnetic flux tube.
   This paper attempts to relate them to one another through a series of
   magnetoconvective calculations. The first process is the balancing of
   the Lorentz force by radial gradients in the buoyancy force. It was
   first found in the Boussinesq regime, where it was studied in the late
   1970s by Galloway, Proctor T Weiss. A similar balance can occur in the
   fully compressible case, where we refer to it as quasi-Boussinesq (QB).
   The second process involves a balance between an outward-directed
   radial pressure gradient and radial gradients in the buoyancy force
   outside the tube. This is the mechanism proposed in the early 1990s by
   Kerswell T Childress (the KC mechanism). The third mechanism,
   convective collapse (CC), is a process whereby a flux tube can evolve
   to a high field strength because of an instability due to the
   superadiabaticity of the material within the tube. Until now, it has
   been studied using the so-called `thin flux tube' approximation in
   which convective motions are ignored even though there is a background
   superadiabatic density stratification. Here we place these three
   mechanisms in a unified framework and explore the transitions between
   the solutions as various parameters are varied. In particular, we show
   that the QB solutions are preferred for a wide range of parameters,
   whereas CC solutions occur only in very specific circumstances. In
   particular, on the Sun, the latter are probably limited to flux tubes
   with radii less than approximately 10 km, the turbulent magnetic
   diffusivity length-scale.}},

Abstract = {{A new simulation set-up is proposed for studying mean field dynamo
   action. The model combines the computational advantages of local
   Cartesian geometry with the ability to include a shear profile that
   resembles the sun's differential rotation at low latitudes. It is shown
   that in a two-dimensional mean field model this geometry produces
   cyclic solutions with dynamo waves traveling away from the equator - as
   expected for a positive alpha effect in the northern hemisphere. In
   three dimensions with turbulence driven by a helical forcing function,
   an alpha effect is self-consistently generated in the presence of a
   finite imposed toroidal magnetic field. The results suggest that, due
   to a finite flux of current helicity out of the domain, alpha quenching
   appears to be non-catastrophic - at least for intermediate values of
   the magnetic Reynolds number. For larger values of the magnetic
   Reynolds number, however, there is evidence for a reversal of the trend
   and that a may decrease with increasing magnetic Reynolds number.
   Control experiments with closed boundaries confirm that in the absence
   of a current helicity flux, but with shear as before, alpha quenching
   is always catastrophic and alpha decreases inversely proportional to
   the magnetic Reynolds number. For solar parameters, our results suggest
   a current helicity flux of about 0.001 G(2)/s. This corresponds to a
   magnetic helicity flux, integrated over the northern hemisphere and
   over the 11 year solar cycle, of about 10(46) Mx(2).}},

Abstract = {{Nonergodic attractors can robustly appear in symmetric systems as
   structurally stable cycles between saddle-type invariant sets. These
   saddles may be chaotic giving rise to ``cycling chaos.{''} The
   robustness of such attractors appears by virtue of the fact that the
   connections are robust within some invariant subspace. We consider two
   previously studied examples and examine these in detail for a number of
   effects: (i) presence of internal symmetries within the chaotic
   saddles, (ii) phase-resetting, where only a limited set of connecting
   trajectories between saddles are possible, and (iii) multistability of
   periodic orbits near bifurcation to cycling attractors. The first model
   consists of three cyclically coupled Lorenz equations and was
   investigated first by Dellnitz {[}Int. J. Bifurcation Chaos Appl. Sci.
   Eng. 5, 1243-1247 (1995)]. We show that one can find a ``false
   phase-resetting{''} effect here due to the presence of a skew product
   structure for the dynamics in an invariant subspace; we verify this by
   considering a more general bi-directional coupling. The presence of
   internal symmetries of the chaotic saddles means that the set of
   connections can never be clean in this system, that is, there will
   always be transversely repelling orbits within the saddles that are
   transversely attracting on average. Nonetheless we argue that
   ``anomalous connections{''} are rare. The second model we consider is
   an approximate return mapping near the stable manifold of a saddle in a
   cycling attractor from a magnetoconvection problem previously
   investigated by two of the authors. Near resonance, we show that the
   model genuinely is phase-resetting, and there are indeed stable
   periodic orbits of arbitrarily long period close to resonance, as
   previously conjectured. We examine the set of nearby periodic orbits in
   both parameter and phase space and show that their structure appears to
   be much more complicated than previously suspected. In particular, the
   basins of attraction of the periodic orbits appear to be pseudo-riddled

Abstract = {{We study stellar convection using a local three-dimensional MHD model,
   with which we investigate the influence of rotation and large-scale
   magnetic fields on the turbulent momentum and heat transport and their
   role in generating large-scale flows in stellar convection zones. The
   former is studied by computing the turbulent velocity correlations,
   known as Reynolds stresses, the latter by calculating the correlation
   of velocity and temperature fluctuations, both as functions of rotation
   and latitude. We find that the horizontal correlation, Q(thetaphi),
   capable of generating horizontal differential rotation, attains
   significant values and is mostly negative in the southern hemisphere
   for Coriolis numbers exceeding unity, corresponding to equatorward flux
   of angular momentum. This result is also in accordance with solar
   observations. The radial component Q(rphi) is negative for slow and
   intermediate rotation indicating inward transport of angular momentum,
   while for rapid rotation, the transport occurs outwards.
   Parametrisation in terms of the mean-field Lambda-effect shows
   qualitative agreement with the turbulence model of Kichatinov \&
   Radiger (1993) for the horizontal part H proportional to
   Q(thetaphi)/cos theta whereas for the vertical Lambda-effect, V
   proportional to Q(rphi)/sin theta, agreement only for intermediate
   rotation exists. The Lambda-coefficients become suppressed in the limit
   of rapid rotation, this rotational quenching being stronger and
   occurring with slower rotation for the V component than for H. We have
   also studied the behaviour of the Reynolds stresses under the influence
   of a large-scale azimuthal magnetic field of varying strength. We find
   that the stresses are enhanced by the presence of the magnetic field
   for field strengths up to and above the equipartition value, without
   significant quenching. Concerning the turbulent heat transport, our
   calculations show that the transport in the radial direction is most
   efficient at the equatorial regions, obtains a minimum at midlatitudes,
   and shows a slight increase towards the poles. The latitudinal heat
   transport does not show a systematic trend as a function of latitude or
   rotation.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first center-to-limb G-band images synthesized from
   high-resolution simulations of solar magnetoconvection. Toward the limb
   the simulations show ``hilly{''} granulation with dark bands on the far
   side, bright granulation walls, and striated faculae, similar to
   observations. At disk center G-band bright points are flanked by dark
   lanes. The increased brightness in magnetic elements is due to their
   lower density compared with the surrounding intergranular medium. One
   thus sees deeper layers where the temperature is higher. At a given
   geometric height, the magnetic elements are cooler than the surrounding
   medium. In the G band, the contrast is further increased by the
   destruction of CH in the low-density magnetic elements. The optical
   depth unity surface is very corrugated. Bright granules have their
   continuum optical depth unity 80 km above the mean surface, the
   magnetic elements 200-300 km below. The horizontal temperature gradient
   is especially large next to flux concentrations. When viewed at an
   angle, the deep magnetic elements' optical surface is hidden by the
   granules and the bright points are no longer visible, except where the
   ``magnetic valleys{''} are aligned with the line of sight. Toward the
   limb, the low density in the strong magnetic elements causes unit
   line-of-sight optical depth to occur deeper in the granule walls behind
   than for rays not going through magnetic elements, and variations in
   the field strength produce a striated appearance in the bright granule
   walls.}},

Abstract = {{A model system of partial differential equations in two dimensions is
   derived from the three-dimensional equations for thermal convection in
   a horizontal fluid layer in a vertical magnetic field. The model
   consists of an equation of Swift-Hohenberg type for the amplitude of
   convection, coupled to an equation for a large-scale mode representing
   the local strength of the magnetic field. The model facilitates both
   analytical and numerical studies of magnetoconvection in large domains.
   In particular, we investigate the phenomenon of flux separation, where
   the domain divides into regions of strong convection with a weak
   magnetic field and regions of weak convection with a strong field.
   Analytical predictions of flux separation based on weakly nonlinear
   analysis are extended into the fully nonlinear regime through numerical
   simulations. The results of the model are compared with simulations of
   the full three-dimensional magnetoconvection problem.}},

Abstract = {{To compare the gravity field effect on copper-electroless plating with
   the magnetic field effect on the same reaction, the plating rates were
   measured under various vertical gravity fields. Consequently,
   considerably different results from those of the magnetic-field case,
   where the reaction was suppressed by the magnetic field, were obtained;
   the reaction was not suppressed but promoted by the gravity field. The
   total reaction rate increased with increasing gravitational
   acceleration, and followed the diffusion current equation in a vertical
   gravity field. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation also
   revealed the promotion by the gravity field, i.e., the increase of
   crystal sizes with increasing gravitational acceleration. This is
   because, in the magnetic field, the micro-magnetohydrodynamic
   (micro-MHD) flows interact with the nonequilibrium fluctuations
   accompanying the reaction. Therefore, it was concluded that the gravity
   convection cells occurring under gravity fields do not interact at
   least up to 170G with the nonequilibrium fluctuations. At the same
   time, the density coefficients intrinsic to cathodic and anodic partial
   reactions were obtained by measuring current responses to sweeping
   gravitational acceleration, i.e., sweep gravitammetry. By comparing
   observed data with those calculated from the density coefficients, it
   was clarified that the autocatalytic process between the cathodic and
   anodic reactions is more accelerated by gravity convection than the
   intrinsic autocatalytic process without gravity convection.}},

Abstract = {{We report on numerical study of effects of orientation and distribution
   of an external magnetic field on the reorganization of convective
   structures and heat transfer in thermal convection in electrically
   conductive fluids. The simulations were performed using a transient
   RANS (T-RANS) approach in which the large-scale deterministic
   structures are numerically resolved in time and space and the
   unresolved contribution is modelled using an algebraic stress-flux
   three-equation subscale model. For low Prandtl (Pr) fluids the subscale
   model was extended to include Pr-dependent molecular dissipation of
   heat flux. The method was first validated in natural convection in a
   side-heated cubical enclosure subjected to magnetic fields of different
   orientation, strength and penetration depth, showing good agreement
   with the previous benchmark studies. Subsequently, a series of
   simulations was performed of turbulent Rayleigh-Benard convection
   subjected to different magnetic fields over a range of Rayleigh (Ra)
   and Hartmann (Ha) numbers. The computed Nusselt number showed good
   agreement with the available experimental results. Numerical
   visualization of instantaneous flow patterns showed dramatic
   differences in the convective structures and local heat transfer for
   different orientation of the magnetic field with respect to the
   gravitation vector. A gradual, step-like increase in the magnetic
   strength revealed an interesting outcome of the ``competition{''}
   between the buoyancy and the Lorentz forces, leading first to chaotic
   transition and eventually to laminarization. For specific ranges of Ha,
   it was found that a local magnetic field confined to the wall boundary
   layer along the thermally active walls provides almost equal effects as
   the homogeneous field over the whole flow, indicating an interesting
   possibility for controlling thermal convection and associated heat
   transfer. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In an experiment carried out by Aurnou and Olson {[}J. Fluid Mech. 430,
   283 (2001)] thermal convection in a liquid gallium layer in the
   presence of a uniform vertical magnetic field was investigated. The
   critical Rayleigh number at the onset of magnetoconvection was
   determined as a function of the Chandrasekhar number Q (the ratio of
   the Lorentz force to the viscous force) and the Taylor number T-a (the
   squared ratio of the Coriolis force to the viscous force). In the
   experimental apparatus, the upper and lower boundaries of the liquid

   paper presents a study of the effect of electrically conducting walls

Abstract = {{As the magnetic flux in a pore increases, it grows in radius and the
   magnetic field at its outer edge becomes increasingly inclined to the
   vertical. It is believed that this increased field inclination causes
   filamentary convection to set in and that this new pattern of
   convection eventually develops into the highly fluted azimuthal
   structure of sunspots. The linear instability was investigated in a
   highly idealized Boussinesq model by Tildesley. A non-linear extension
   of this work is carried out here and the saturation of the instability
   is explored. These solutions are contrasted with those obtained when
   the upper-boundary condition is modified by matching the magnetic field
   to a potential field above the convecting layer. In the non-linear
   regime an alternating pattern of hot and cool stripes is produced at
   the upper surface. The results from these model calculations are
   related to the transition from pores to protospots and to the
   development of penumbral filaments in sunspots.}},

Month = {{JAN 25}},
Abstract = {{We consider the finite-amplitude instability of incompressible
   spherical Couette flow between two concentric spheres of radii R-1 and
   R-2 (>R-1) in the narrow-gap limit, epsilon = (R-2 - R-1)/R-1 much less
   than 1, caused by rotating them both about a common axis with distinct
   angular velocities Ohm(1) and Ohm(2) respectively. In this limit it is
   well-known that the onset of (global) linear instability is manifested
   by Taylor vortices of roughly square cross-section close to the
   equator. According to linear theory this occurs at a critical Taylor
   number Tit which, remarkably, exceeds the local value T, obtained by
   approximating the spheres as cylinders in the vicinity of the equator
   even as epsilon down arrow 0. Previous theoretical work on this problem
   has concentrated on the case of almost co-rotation with delta
   approximate to (Ohm(1) - Ohm(2))Ohm(1) = O(epsilon(1/2)) for which
   T-crit = T-c + O(delta(2)) + O(epsilon). In this limit the amplitude
   equation that governs the spatio-temporal modulation of the vortices on
   the latitudinal extent O(epsilon(1/2) R-1) gives rise to an interesting
   bifurcation sequence. In particular, the appearance of global
   bifurcations heralds the onset of complicated subcritical
   time-dependent finite-amplitude solutions.
   Here we switch attention to the case when epsilon(1/2) much less than
   delta less than or equal to 1. We show that for Taylor numbers T = T-c
   + O((deltaepsilon)(2/3)) there exists a locally unstable region of
   width O((deltaepsilon)R-1/3(1)) within which the amplitude equation
   admits solutions in the form of pulse-trains. Each pulse oscillates at
   a frequency proportional to its distance from the equatorial plane and
   consists of a wave propagating towards the equator under an envelope.
   The pulse drifts at a slow speed (relative to the wave velocity)
   proportional to its distance (and away) from the equator. Both the
   wavelength and the envelope width possess the same relatively short
   length scale O((epsilon(2)/delta)R-1/3(1)). The appropriate theory of
   spatially periodic pulse-trains is developed and numerical solutions
   found. Significantly, these solutions are strongly subcritical and have
   the property that T --> T-c as epsilon down arrow 0. Two particular
   limits of our theory are examined. In the first, epsilon(1/2) much less
   than delta much less than 1, the spheres almost co-rotate and the pulse
   drift velocity is negligible. A comparison is made of the pulse-train
   predictions with previously obtained numerical results pertaining to
   large (but finite) values of delta/epsilon(1/2). The agreement is
   excellent, despite the complicated long-time behaviour caused by
   inhomogeneity across the relatively wide unstable region.
   Our second special case delta = 1 relates to the situation when the
   outer sphere is at rest. Now the poleward drift of the pulses leads to
   a slow but exponential increase of their separation with time. This
   systematic pulse movement, over and above the spatial inhomogeneity
   just mentioned, necessarily leads to complicated and presumably chaotic
   spatio-temporal behaviour across the wide unstable region of width
   O(epsilon(1/3)R(1)) on its associated time scale, which is
   O(epsilon(-1/3)) longer than the wave period. In view of the several
   length and time scales involved only qualitative comparison with
   experimental results is feasible. Nevertheless, the pulse-train
   structure is robust and likely to provide the building block of the
   ensuing complex dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the possibility of measuring magnetic field strength in
   G-band bright points through the analysis of Zeeman polarization in
   molecular CH lines. To this end we solve the equations of polarized
   radiative transfer in the G band through a standard plane-parallel
   model of the solar atmosphere with an imposed magnetic field and
   through a more realistic snapshot from a simulation of solar
   magnetoconvection. This region of the spectrum is crowded with many
   atomic and molecular lines. Nevertheless, we find several instances of
   isolated groups of CH lines that are predicted to produce a measurable
   Stokes V signal in the presence of magnetic fields. In part this is
   possible because the effective Lande factors of lines in the stronger
   main branch of the CH A(2)Delta-X(2)Pi transition tend to zero rather
   quickly for increasing total angular momentum J, resulting in a Stokes
   V spectrum of the G band that is less crowded than the corresponding
   Stokes I spectrum. We indicate that, by contrast, the effective Lande
   factors of the R and P satellite subbranches of this transition tend to
   +/-1 for increasing J. However, these lines are in general considerably
   weaker and do not contribute significantly to the polarization signal.
   In one wavelength location near 430.4 nm, the overlap of several
   magnetically sensitive and nonsensitive CH lines is predicted to result
   in a single-lobed Stokes V profile, raising the possibility of high
   spatial resolution narrowband polarimetric imaging. In the
   magnetoconvection snapshot we find circular polarization signals of the
   order of 1\%, prompting us to conclude that measuring magnetic field
   strength in small-scale elements through the Zeeman effect in CH lines
   is a realistic prospect.}},

   linearly on the relative orientation of gravity and rotation, with the
   solution for arbitrary orientation being a linear combination of two
   limiting cases in which these vectors are colinear (polar case) and
   perpendicular (equatorial case). The perturbation magnetic field

Abstract = {{The penumbra radiates an energy flux that is roughly 75\% of the
   quiet-sun value. One mechanism proposed to bring this flux to the
   surface is interchange convection of magnetic flux tubes according to
   which hot flux tubes rise to the surface, cool off their heat by
   radiation and sink down again. Another way to deposit heat in the
   penumbral photosphere is by steady upflows along magnetic flux tubes.
   We discuss these two mechanisms and elaborate on consequences that can
   be compared with and constrained by observations. We estimate the time
   scales for variations of the intensity and the magnetic field pattern.
   By comparing them with the corresponding observed time scales, we find
   that pure interchange convection is unable to account for the observed
   penumbral heat flux. Heating the penumbra by steady upflows along
   magnetic flux tubes, however, turns out to be sufficient to explain the
   penumbral brightness, under the condition that significant magnetic
   return flux is present within the penumbra. Associated with the
   magnetic return flux, downflows within the penumbra should be present,
   in accordance with recent observational findings of such downflows.
   Exploring other possible heating mechanisms, we find that dissipation
   of magnetic energy is negligible, while dissipation of the kinetic
   energy of the Evershed flow could contribute significantly to the
   brightness of the penumbra.}},

Abstract = {{The linear magnetoconvection in the rotating uniformly as well as
   non-uniformly stratified horizontal layer with azimuthal magnetic field
   is investigated for the various mechanical and electrical boundary
   conditions and especially, for various values of Roberts number. The
   developed diffusive perturbations (modes) are strongly influenced not
   only by the mentioned properties of boundaries but also by complicated
   coupling of viscous, thermal and magnetic diffusive processes. The mean
   electromotive force produced by developed hydromagnetic instabilities
   is also investigated to determine the hydromagnetic processes which are
   appropriate for alpha-effect. The presented paper is an unification of
   hitherto published results of the authors and gives a short survey of
   many developments of corresponding model by Soward (1979).}},

   low (e.g., 10 or 30\% exchange ratio), the currents at angles of 0 and

Abstract = {{We compare, by means of fractal analyses, the shapes of observed

   spectrometer at the Vacuum Tower Telescope at the Observatorio del
   Teide on Tenerife. Magnetograms with 0.{''}4-0.{''}(5) spatial
   resolution were obtained from two-dimensional Stokes V polarimetry in
   the Fe I 6302.5 Angstrom line and by image reconstruction with speckle
   methods. The simulations of magnetoconvection was performed with the
   MURAM code. It solves the time-dependent MHD equations for a
   compressible, partly ionized plasma including radiative transfer in
   LTE. To determine the fractal dimensions the perimeter-area relation is
   used. We discuss the influence of seeing and noise in the fractal
   dimension D of the observed magnetograms. A dependence of D on the
   distance from disk center could not be found. The observations give D =
   1.21 +/- 0.05 for a pixel size corresponding to 0.{''}105, while for
   the numerical simulations D = 1.38 +/- 0.07 for a pixel size of 20.83

   with the simulations. This agreement is remarkable since the pixel
   sizes and spatial resolutions of the simulations and of the
   observations differ by a factor of 15. The finding supports the view of
   self-similarity of solar magnetic structures over a large range of
   scales. In addition, it demonstrates the realism of the simulations and
   suggests that all important physical processes are included. We discuss

   spatially resolved spectral line profiles with the center-of-gravity (
   COG) method. For this purpose, theoretical non-LTE polarized line
   profiles of a series of Fe I lines were calculated through a
   two-dimensional slice from a snapshot of a three-dimensional solar
   magnetoconvection simulation. The calculated profiles were analyzed
   with the COG method for all positions along the slice, and retrieved
   values of velocity and field strength were compared with actual values
   at the heights of formation of the lines. The average formation heights
   of the employed lines range from 60 to almost 400 km above the average
   photospheric level. The COG method appears reliable for measuring
   velocities in the lower half of these formation heights and for
   measuring field strength over the whole range of heights, for fields up
   to intermediate strength. Moreover, it is shown that the COG
   determination is independent of spectral resolution, making it
   particularly suitable for applications that require high throughput and
   a correspondingly large spectral bandpass, such as high spatial
   resolution observations with a large-diameter telescope. Finally, the

Abstract = {{The question of whether kinematic alpha(2)-shell-dynamos are able to
   produce a cyclic activity is addressed. The alpha-effect is allowed to
   be latitudinally inhomogeneous and anisotropic but it is assumed as
   radially uniform in the turbulent shell. For a symmetric alpha-tensor
   we only find oscillatory solutions if i) the alpha-tensor component
   alpha(zz) vanishes or is of the opposite sign as alpha(phiphi), ii) the
   alpha-effect is strongly concentrated in the equatorial region and iii)
   the alpha-effect is concentrated in a rather thin outer shell. In the
   other cases almost always the nonaxisymmetric field mode S1 ( which
   slowly drifts along the azimuthal direction) possesses the lowest
   critical dynamo number. The uniform but anisotropic alpha-effect (e.g.
   alpha(zz) = 0) leads to nonaxisymmetric solutions as is experimentally
   confirmed by the Karlsruhe dynamo installation.
   One of the antisymmetric parts of the alpha-tensor, however, plays the
   role of differential rotation in the induction equation. Using the
   results of a numerical simulation for the alpha-tensor of the solar
   convection zone for the radial profile of this effect, one finds the
   possibility of oscillating alpha(2)-dynamos even without the existence
   of a real nonuniform rotation law. Compared with the results of
   numerical simulations of the full alpha-tensor, the amplitude of the
   antisymmetric part of the tensor must be artifically increased by only
   a factor of three in order to find oscillating solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulations provide a strategy for modelling large-scale
   flow when the smallest scales are not resolved. The approach relies on
   spatial filtering to eliminate scales smaller than the grid spacing,
   but requires models for the influence of the subgrid scales. We
   investigate four subgrid-scale models in numerical calculations of
   magnetoconvection in the Earth's core. Three of the models are based on
   eddy diffusivities, while the fourth is the similarity model of Bardina
   et al. (1980). The predictions of the subgrid-scale models are tested
   using a direct numerical simulation (DNS), which resolves the smallest
   dissipative scales. In order to achieve the required resolution we
   restrict the calculations to a small volume of the core with periodic
   boundary conditions. The grid is a cube with 128 x 64 x 32 nodes,
   oriented so that the z-coordinate is aligned with the rotation axis and
   the y-coordinate is parallel to an imposed magnetic field. The
   direction of gravity may be oriented arbitrarily in the x-z plane and
   several representative cases are considered. Output from the DNS is
   filtered on to a coarser grid prior to evaluating the subgrid-scale
   models. The results are compared with estimates of the subgrid-scale
   heat and momentum fluxes calculated from the fully resolved solution.
   Substantial anisotropy in the subgrid-scale fluxes is caused by the
   influences of rotation and the imposed magnetic field. Models based on
   scalar eddy diffusivities are incapable of reproducing this anisotropy,
   whereas the similarity model gives a good match to the amplitude and
   spatial distribution of the subgrid-scale fluxes.}},

Abstract = {{Various effects of penetration in rotating magnetoconvection are
   studied by means of three-dimensional numerical simulations employing
   the code NIRVANA. A local, 2-layer model is applied dividing the
   computational domain ( which is a rectangular box placed tangentially
   on a sphere at latitude 45degrees) in an unstable polytropic region on
   top of a stable polytropic region. Different realizations of convection
   are examined parameterized by Taylor numbers Ta = \{0, 6 x 10(4), 6 x
   10(5)\} and magnetic field strengths beta = \{5, 50, 500, 5000,
   infinity\}. We find a rather distinctive behavior of the penetration
   depth Delta on the system parameters (Ta, beta). In non-rotating
   convection Delta is a monotonically decreasing function of beta(-1)
   which is due to magnetic quenching effects. Also, penetration is
   subject to rotational quenching, i.e. Delta is reduced for increasing
   rotation rate. In the intermediate regime of (Ta; beta), the effects of
   rotation and magnetic field on Delta do not simply add (see Fig. 3). We
   find, nevertheless, a very strong reduction of the penetration depth of
   overshooting turbulence by both rotation and magnetism. Penetrative
   convection is closely associated with the mixing of a passive scalar
   quantity advected with the flow. In the long term, the tracer material
   penetrates significantly deeper into the stable layer than suggested by
   Delta which is due to the cumulative effect of isolated, fast-moving
   plumes. In case of a weak magnetic field, penetrative convection also
   serves to ensure a downward transport of magnetic flux by turbulent
   pumping with an average rate gamma(z) approximate to - 7 x 10(-3)
   measured in units of the sound speed at the top z-boundary. For larger
   magnetic fields the pumping effect is quenched and even changes sign in
   the convection zone. This effect is suggested as being due to the
   effect of ``turbulent buoyancy{''} which in density-stratified media
   transports a given magnetic field upwards if it is not too strong
   (Kichatinov Rudiger 1992).}},

Abstract = {{An effect of rotation on a developed turbulent stratified convection is

   Different properties of the effective drift velocity of the mean

   depending on the rate of rotation; (ii) there is a difference in the

Abstract = {{The linear stability of magnetoconvection in a rapidly rotating sphere
   is investigated. The weak-field regime is studied where the Elsasser
   number Lambda is O(E-1/3) and E is the Ekman number, assumed to be
   small. In this regime, the magnetic field is strong enough to affect
   the critical Rayleigh number, frequency and preferred azimuthal
   wavenumber by order-one amounts, but is weak enough that the convection
   still has the form of columnar rolls. A global asymptotic theory is
   constructed that differs from previous local theories of the onset of
   convection at asymptotically small Ekman number, and it provides a
   consistent Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin solution which takes account of
   the phase-mixing phenomenon.
   The asymptotic theory is developed to give the leading-order and
   first-order correction terms, including those from Hartmann boundary
   layers. Numerical solutions of the relevant partial differential
   equations have also been found, for values of the Ekman number down to
   10(-6.5), and these are compared with the asymptotic theory. Good
   agreement with the asymptotic theory is found.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous paper {[}Physica D 137 (2000) 260], an inhomogeneous
   complex Landau equation was derived in the context of the amplitude
   modulation of Taylor vortices between two rapidly rotating concentric
   spheres, which bound a narrow gap and almost co-rotate about a common
   axis of symmetry. In this weakly nonlinear regime the latitudinal
   vortex width is comparable to the gap between the shells. The vortices
   are located close to the equator and are modulated on a latitudinal
   length scale large compared to the gap width but small compared to the
   shell radius. The system is characterised by two parameters: lambda,
   which is proportional to the Taylor number, and kappa, which provides a
   measure of phase mixing. Only when the inner and outer spheres almost
   co-rotate is kappa of order unity; otherwise kappa is large. In
   {[}Physica D 137 (2000) 260], it was shown that there is a finite
   amplitude steady solution branch at fixed kappa that connects the first
   two bifurcation points lambda(0) and lambda(1). For sufficiently large
   kappa, the branch lies on lambda(0) less than or equal to lambda less
   than or equal to lambda(1), but for smaller kappa it extends beyond
   lambda(1); there on lambda(1) < lambda < lambda(N) a large and small
   amplitude solution co-exist and coalesce at the nose of the branch,
   lambda(N). In this paper we investigate both analytically and
   numerically the stability of the steady solutions and their subsequent
   evolution. Two types of modes exist-one (SP) preserves the reflectional
   symmetry of the steady solutions with respect to the equatorial plane,
   while the other (SB) breaks it. Three SP-global bifurcation scenarios
   are identified. Each lead to limit cycles, which correspond to vortices
   drifting towards the equator from both sides. For small kappa, a
   heteroclinic connection is made between the steady nose solution and
   its reversed flow state (opposite sign). The same occurs for moderate
   kappa except that two oppositely signed small amplitude steady
   solutions are connected. For large kappa a homoclinic cycle forms
   joining the undisturbed state to itself and this leads to a gluing
   bifurcation. This homoclinic cycle evolves from the vacillating wave
   limit cycle shed by an SP-Hopf bifurcation of the large amplitude
   solution. An SB-pitchfork bifurcation of the steady solutions leads to
   asymmetric drifting-phase solutions (travelling waves). Time-stepping
   reveals that they are generally unstable and evolve into larger
   amplitude periodic solutions, which for small and moderate kappa are
   SP-states. For large kappa, the SB-drifting-phase solutions are
   strongly subcritical. The realised larger amplitude periodic state, to
   which they evolve, may be either of SB- or SP-type depending on the
   value of lambda. These complicated solutions consist of trains of
   stationary pulses each modulating travelling waves with distinct
   frequencies. The asymmetric SB-waves correspond to vortices drifting
   across the equator; yet far from it, where these vortices are very
   weak, they drift towards the equator as in the case of the SP-waves.

   top of the layer, mimicking a sunspot. This two-dimensional steady
   state is then perturbed in the third direction, to seek filamentary

Abstract = {{Thermal convection in a fluid-filled gap between the two corotating,

   radial buoyancy was first studied by Busse (Busse, F.H., ``Thermal
   instabilities in rapidly rotating systems{''}, J. Fluid Mech . 44 ,
   441-460 (1970)). The annulus model captures the key features of
   rotating convection in full spherical geometry and has been widely
   employed to study convection, magnetoconvection and dynamos in
   planetary systems, usually in connection with the small-gap
   approximation neglecting the effect of azimuthal curvature of the
   annulus. This article investigates nonlinear thermal convection in a
   rotating annulus with a finite gap through numerical simulations of the
   full set of nonlinear convection equations. Three representative cases
   are investigated in detail: a large-gap annulus with the ratio of the
   radii (s(i) and s(o)) of the sidewalls xi = s(i)/o(s) = 0.1, a
   medium-gap annulus with xi = 0.35 and a small-gap annulus with xi = 0.8.
   Near the onset of convection, the effect of rapid rotation through the
   sloping ends forces the first (Hopf) bifurcation in the form of
   small-scale, steadily drifting rolls (thermal Rossby waves). At
   moderately large Rayleigh numbers, a variety of different convection
   patterns are found, including mixed-mode steadily drifting,
   quasi-periodic (vacillating) and temporally chaotic convection in
   association with various temporal and spatial symmetry-breaking
   bifurcations. Our extensive simulations suggest that competition
   between nonlinear and rotational effects with increasing Rayleigh
   number leads to an unusual sequence of bifurcation characterized by

Abstract = {{Thermal instabilities in the form of oscillatory magnetoconvection

Abstract = {{In deeply convective stars, the nonthermal energy required to heat the
   chromosphere ultimately is supplied by turbulent magnetoconvection.
   Because the early and middle A stars have very shallow convective
   layers, they are not expected to produce enough magnetoconvective power
   to sustain luminous chromospheres or hot coronae. Here we describe a
   search for chromospheric emission in the far-ultraviolet (905-1185
   Angstrom) spectra of seven main-sequence A stars, based on observations
   from the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) telescope. Our
   survey spans the interval in effective temperature along the main
   sequence over which powerful subsurface convection zones and hence
   chromospheric emission are expected to vanish. The presence or absence
   of high-temperature emissions in our FUSE spectra therefore can be used
   to identify the locus for the transition from convective to radiative
   envelopes-a change in stellar structure that is difficult to assess by
   other means. We present our observations and analysis of the subcoronal
   emission lines of C III lambdalambda977, 1175 and O VI
   lambdalambda1032, 1037, which bracket a range in formation temperatures
   from 50,000 to 300,000 K. To supplement our FUSE observations, we also
   report Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph measurements of Si III
   lambda1206 and H I Lyalpha lambda1215, obtained from archival
   observations of the Hubble Space Telescope, as well as X-ray
   measurements from previous ROSAT survey and pointed observations. We
   detected C III and O VI emission features in the FUSE spectra of the
   coolest stars of our sample, at T-eff less than or similar to 8200 K.
   When normalized to the bolometric luminosities, the detected
   emission-line fluxes are comparable to solar values. We detected none
   of the hotter stars in our survey at T-eff greater than or equal to
   8300 K. Upper limits on the normalized flux in some instances approach
   40 times less than solar. Within an uncertainty in the effective
   temperature scale of up to several hundred kelvins, our FUSE
   observations indicate that the transition between convective and
   radiative stellar envelopes takes place at, or very near, the point
   along the main sequence where stellar structure models predict and,
   moreover, that the changeover occurs very abruptly, over a temperature
   interval no greater than similar to100 K in width. Our FUSE sample also
   includes two binary stars. In both cases, the narrow UV line profiles
   we have observed suggest that the high-temperature emission is most
   likely associated with the late-type companions rather than the A stars
   themselves.}},

Abstract = {{We study the pumping of magnetic flux in three-dimensional compressible

   convection has attained a statistically stationary state, a magnetic
   field is introduced. The magnetic field is subsequently modified by the
   convective motions, and the resulting pumping effects are isolated by
   calculating various coefficients of the expansion of the electromotive
   force, (u x b) over bar, in terms of components of the mean magnetic
   field. The dependence of the pumping effects on rotation, latitude and
   other parameters is studied. First numerical evidence is found for the
   existence of pumping effects in the horizontal directions. Evidence is
   found that the pumping effects act differently on different components
   of the mean magnetic field. Latitudinal pumping is mainly equatorward
   for a toroidal field, and can be poleward for a poloidal field.
   Longitudinal pumping is mainly retrograde for the radial field but
   prograde for the latitudinal field. The pumping effect in the vertical
   direction is found to be dominated by the diamagnetic effect,
   equivalent to a predominating downward advection with a maximum speed

Abstract = {{We study hydromagnetic waves driven by thermal convection in a

   both poloidal and toroidal axisymmetric magnetic fields. The imposed
   magnetic fields satisfy electrically insulating boundary conditions at
   both surfaces of the shell and have an equatorial dipolar symmetry. The
   system is a model of the cores of the Earth and other planets, where
   magnetic fields are generated. We focus on the effect of poloidal
   magnetic fields at an asymptotically small Ekman number E = 10(-6). We
   find two new modes for convection-driven hydromagnetic waves. When the
   poloidal field is larger than the toroidal field, the waves propagate
   rapidly eastwards and concentrate just outside the ``tangent
   cylinder{''}, which has axis parallel to the rotation axis and just
   encloses the inner sphere. When the poloidal field is comparable to the
   toroidal field the waves also propagate eastwards but concentrate
   inside the tangent cylinder. When the toroidal field is larger than the
   poloidal field the waves propagate slowly either eastwards or westwards
   and concentrate on lower to middle latitudes. In all the three cases,
   the flow approximately satisfies the two-dimensional Proudman-Taylor
   constraint, even though the theorem does not strictly apply because the

Abstract = {{The role of magnetic field in the inhibition of natural convection
   driven by combined buoyancy and surface tension forces in a horizontal
   layer of an electrically conducting Boussinesq fluid with suspended
   particles confined between an upper free/adiabatic and a lower
   rigid/isothermal boundary is considered in 1g and mug situations. The
   inhibition of convection is caused by a stationary and uniform magnetic
   field parallel to the gravity field. The magnetically-inert suspended
   particles are not directly influenced by the magnetic field but are
   influenced indirectly by the magnetically responding carrier fluid in
   which they are suspended. A linear stability analysis of the system is
   performed. The Rayleigh-Ritz technique is used to obtain the
   eigenvalues. The influence of various parameters on the onset of
   convection has been analysed. Six different reference steady-state
   temperature profiles are considered and their comparative influence on
   onset is discussed. Treating Marangoni number as the critical parameter
   it is shown that any particular infinitesimal disturbance can be
   stabilized with a sufficiently strong magnetic field. It is observed
   that the electrically conducting fluid layer with suspended particles
   heated from below is more stable compared to the classical electrically
   conducting fluid layer without suspended particles. The critical wave

Abstract = {{This paper reports 3D numerical simulations of compressible, thermal
   convection in a small rectilinear domain placed tangentially on a
   rotating sphere at latitude 45degrees. The spatiotemporal evolution of
   convection is studied in an initially non-homogeneous toroidal magnetic
   field located at the interface of a 2-layer unstable/stable polytropic
   stratification. The effects from a variation of the rotation rate and
   magnetic field strength are explored. In weak field convection the
   solutions bear close resemblance to the field-free situation with the
   magnetic field treated as a passive ingredient. In this case a
   significant amount of magnetic energy is transported downwards into the
   stable layer by penetrative motions where the field is concentrated in
   small-scale tube-like features. In the case of a dominating magnetic
   field, the overall structure of convection changes dramatically towards
   a two-dimensional, more laminar flow with convective motions occurring
   in columnar cells aligned with the mean magnetic field. The latter
   quickly becomes at in the convection zone due to magnetic buoyancy
   effects. Magnetic quenching of the flow heavily influences the mixing
   properties of convection, thereby, reducing the fluxes of kinetic
   energy and enthalpy and suppressing the downward transport of magnetic
   energy. Adding rotation in strong field convection generates streaming
   motions parallel to the mean field. These motions contain a large
   fraction of the total kinetic energy. The horizontally-averaged (mean)
   flows, on the other hand, are less energetic. In the presence of strong
   rotation the horizontal mean flows are triggered by inertial
   oscillations. Averaging the mean flows over time gives an estimate for
   steady flows persistent in a convection zone. Whereas the vertical flow
   component obtained in this way shows a systematic dependence on the
   rotation rate and field strength, the flows in the meridional and zonal
   directions depend in a more complex manner on these parameters. This
   includes reversals in their orientation when going from moderate to
   strong rotation and when increasing the magnetic field strength.}},

Abstract = {{Geodynamo models depend on two important parameters: the Ekman and
   Rayleigh numbers. While the difficulty of simulating a geodynamo with
   very small Ekman number has been widely discussed, the Rayleigh number
   has received relatively little attention. The energy budget is rather
   tight, giving hope for a low Rayleigh number and a tractable problem.
   Entropy considerations constrain the Rayleigh number to be large and
   positive. In the special case when the conduction profile in the
   absence of convection has the same functional dependence on radius as
   the adiabatic temperature, the Rayleigh number is simply related to the
   entropies of magnetic and thermal diffusion. In general, the Earth's
   core may be stirred by both thermal and compositional convection, and
   may contain distinct stable regions where no convection occurs, but the
   same entropy argument holds and at least one of the Rayleigh numbers
   must be large and positive in at least one of the convecting regions.
   For molecular diffusivities, the Rayleigh number is enormous, 10(29)
   for thermal convection and 10(38) for compositional convection.
   Turbulent diffusivities give much lower values, 10(12) for thermal and
   10(15) for compositional convection, or 10(3) and 10(6) times the
   critical Rayleigh number for magnetoconvection in a strong magnetic
   field. These values exceed the critical Rayleigh number for
   non-magnetic convection, which is higher than for magnetoconvection by
   a factor of 10(3) for turbulent diffusivities and 10(5) for molecular
   values. Convection in the Earth's core could persist even when the
   geomagnetic field becomes weak, for example during excursions or
   polarity reversal. The turbulent value for thermal convection is low
   enough to be reached in numerical simulations in the near future. (C)

Abstract = {{We present numerical simulations of three-dimensional compressible
   magnetoconvection in a rotating rectangular box that represents a
   section of the solar convection zone. The box contains a convectively
   unstable layer, surrounded by stably stratified layers with
   overshooting convection. The magnetic Reynolds number, Rm, is chosen
   subcritical, thus excluding spontaneous growth of the magnetic field
   through dynamo action, and the magnetic energy is maintained by
   introducing a constant magnetic field into the box, once convection has
   attained a statistically stationary state. Under the influence of the
   Coriolis force, the advection of the magnetic field results in a
   non-vanishing contribution to the mean electric field, given by (u x
   b). From this electric field, we calculate the alpha -effect,
   separately for the stably and the unstably stratified layers, by
   averaging over time and over suitably defined volumes. From the
   variation of alpha we derive an error estimate, and the dependence of
   alpha on rotation and magnetic field strength is studied. Evidence is

   monotonic increase of the horizontal alpha effect with increasing
   rotation. For Rm approximate to 30, our results for both vertical and
   horizontal alpha effect are consistent with magnetic quenching by a

Abstract = {{Recent high-resolution observations, from the ground and from space,
   have revealed the fine structure of magnetic features at the surface of
   the Sun. At the same time, advances in computing power have at last
   made it possible to develop models of turbulent magnetoconvection that
   can be related to these observations. The key features of flux
   emergence and annihilation,as observed by the MDI experiment on SOHO,
   are reproduced in kinematic calculations, while three-dimensional
   numerical experiments reveal the dynamical processes that are involved.
   The pattern od convection depends on the strength of the magnetic
   field: as a mean field decreases, slender rising plumes give way to a
   regime where magnetic flux is separated from the motion and then to one
   where locally intense magnetic fields nestle between broad and
   vigorously convecting plumes. Moreover, turbulent convection is itself
   able to act as a small-scale dynamo, generating disordered fields near
   that solar surface.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to develop a mathematical model for the
   effect of magnetic fields on the corrosion process at an iron electrode
   in a solution containing paramagnetic and diamagnetic cations, Co2+ and
   Fe2+, respectively, and diamagnetic anions SO42-, and to verify the
   mathematical model experimentally. The hypothesis is that, in the
   presence of a magnetic field in solution, where a gradient of
   concentration of paramagnetic ions exists due to some electrode
   reaction in which they participate, an additional driving force acting
   on the solution will arise. This force, which has the same direction as
   the gradient of the paramagnetic ions, will cause a redistribution of
   velocities in the diffusion layer, As a result an additional convective
   transport of all the components of the solution will be generated.
   Correspondingly, limiting currents of reactions proceeding in an
   electrochemical system will become a function of the applied magnetic
   flux density. Experimentally, the study is carried out by
   potentiostatic and open-circuit potential methods, and the results
   obtained show an anodic polarization due to the magnetic field. Both
   the mathematical model developed and the results obtained
   experimentally, show that the magnetic field effect increased with
   increasing magnetic flux density and electrolyte concentration, and
   decreased with increasing stirring rate. The results show no effect due
   to the rate of change of the applied magnetic field, which indicates
   that the effect obtained cannot, apparently, be explained in terms of
   the Lorentz force. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Nu = 0.129Ra(0.272 +/-0.006) over the range 3.0 x 10(3) < Ra < 1.6 x

   thermal oscillations are detected in magnetoconvection at similar to
   1.4Ra(c). For rotating magnetoconvection, we find that the convective
   heat transfer is inhibited by rotation, in general agreement with

Abstract = {{We present the results of a series of numerical experiments that

   transported downward out of a turbulent convecting region and stored in
   a stably stratified region below. This pumping mechanism is believed to
   be a crucial component for the operation of a large-scale solar
   interface dynamo since it may be responsible for the transport of flux
   from the solar convection zone to the stable overshoot region. The
   high-resolution three-dimensional simulations show that efficient
   pumping occurs as a result of the action of strong coherent downflowing
   plumes. The properties of the transport are evaluated as a function of
   magnetic field strength, rotation rate, supercriticality, stiffness of
   the interface, and configuration. The turbulent pumping of magnetic
   flux is remarkably robust and more efficient than its laminar
   counterpart. The turbulent convection naturally amplifies magnetic
   energy from any existing mean field. The transport of flux from the
   convection zone removes the source for this local amplification there,
   and thus the peak magnetic energy also comes to reside in the stable
   region. This is important for an effective interface dynamo.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a new instability of rolls in three related convection
   problems. The instability results in a large-scale modulation of the
   amplitude of the convection (in contrast to a phase instability such as
   that of Eckhaus) and may be supercritical, with strongly
   amplitude-modulated rolls predicted at onset. Essential to the
   instability is the presence of a conserved quantity (whose existence is
   contingent upon an appropriate choice of boundary conditions), which
   gives rise to a corresponding slowly evolving large-scale mode. In
   rotating convection between stress-free boundaries, the conserved
   quantity is the velocity component along the axes of the rolls; in
   magnetoconvection it is the magnetic flux through the layer. In
   rotating magnetoconvection both quantities may be conserved. In each
   case the appropriate amplitude equations to describe convection near
   onset consist of a modulation equation of Ginzburg-Landau type for the
   amplitude of the roils, coupled to a large-scale modulation equation
   for each conserved quantity. The large-scale mode(s), although damped
   according to Linear theory, can destabilise the rolls at onset. It is
   found that rolls are unstable for sufficiently small Prandtl number in
   rotating convection, and for sufficiently small magnetic diffusivity in

Abstract = {{A formulation and an FEM implementation for the solution of an

   addition, the temperature distribution is also prescribed in the part
   Gamma (1) of the boundary Gamma (h1), where the heat flux is known,
   i.e. Gamma (1) is a boundary with overspecified thermal boundary
   conditions. The inverse magneto-convection problem is posed as an
   optimization problem in L-2(Gamma (1) x {[}0, t(max)]) for the
   calculation of the boundary heat flux the q(o)(x, t), with (x, t) is an

Abstract = {{Sunspots, seen as cool regions on the surface of the Sun, are a thermal
   phenomenon. Sunspots are always associated with bipolar magnetic loops
   that break through the solar surface. Thus to explain the origin of
   sunspots we have to understand how the magnetic field originates inside
   the Sun and emerges at its surface. The field predicted by mean-field
   dynamo theories is too weak by itself to emerge at the surface of the
   Sun. However, because of the turbulent character of solar convection
   the fields generated by dynamo are intermittent - i.e., concentrated
   into ropes or sheets with large spaces in between. The intermittent
   fields are sufficiently strong to be able to emerge at the solar
   surface, in spite of the fact that their mean (average) value is weak.
   It is suggested here that magnetic fields emerge at the solar surface
   at those random times and places when the total magnetic field (mean
   field plus fluctuations) exceeds the threshold for buoyancy. The
   clustering of coherently emerged loops results in the formation of a
   sunspot. A non-axisymmetric enhancement of the underlying magnetic
   field causes in the clustering of sunspots forming sunspot groups,
   clusters of activity and active longitudes. The mean field, which is
   not directly observable, is also important, being responsible for the
   ensemble regularities of sunspots, such as Hale's law of sunspot
   polarities and the 11-year periodicity.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic interaction between magnetic field and fluid motion is studied
   through a numerical experiment of nonlinear three-dimensional
   magnetoconvection in a rapidly rotating spherical fluid shell to which
   a uniform magnetic field parallel to its spin axis is applied. The
   fluid shell is heated by internal heat sources to maintain thermal
   convection. The mean value of the magnetic Reynolds number in the fluid
   shell is 22.4 and 10 pairs of axially aligned vortex rolls are stably
   developed. We found that confinement of magnetic flux into
   anti-cyclonic vortex rolls was crucial on an abrupt change of the mode
   of magnetoconvection which occurred at Lambda = 1 similar to 2, where
   Lambda is the Elsasser number. After the mode change, the fluid shell
   can store a large amount of magnetic flux in itself by changing its
   convection style, and the magnetostrophic balance among the Coriolis,
   Lorentz and pressure forces is established. Furthermore, the
   toroidal/poloidal ratio of the induced magnetic energy becomes less
   than unity, and the magnetized anti-cyclones are enlarged due to the
   effect of the magnetic force. Using these key ideas, we investigated
   the causes of the mode change of magnetoconvection. Considering
   relatively large magnetic Reynolds number and a rapid relation rate of
   this model, we believe that these basic ideas used to interpret the
   present numerical experiment can be applied to the dynamics in the
   Earth's and other planetary cores.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops further a convection model that has been studied
   several times previously as a very crude idealization of planetary core
   dynamics. A plane layer of electrically-conducting fluid rotates about
   the vertical in the presence of a magnetic field. Such a field can be
   created spontaneously, as in the Childress-Soward dynamo, but here it
   is uniform, horizontal and externally-applied. The Prandtl number of
   the fluid is large, but the Ekman, Elsasser and Rayleigh numbers are of
   order unity, as is the ratio of thermal to magnetic diffusivity.
   Attention is focused on the onset of convection as the temperature
   difference applied across the layer is increased, and on the preferred
   mode, i.e., the planform and time-dependence of small amplitude
   convection. The case of main interest is the layer confined between
   electrically-insulating no-slip walls, but the analysis is guided by a
   parallel study based on illustrative boundary conditions that are

Year = {{2000}},
Volume = {{419}},
Pages = {{93-124}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{In this article we present new experimental and theoretical results
   which were obtained for the flow between two concentric cylinders, with
   the inner one rotating and in the presence of an axial, stable density
   stratification. This system is characterized by two control parameters:
   one destabilizing, the rotation rate of the inner cylinder; and the
   other stabilizing, the stratification.
   Two oscillatory linear stability analyses assuming axisymmetric flow
   conditions are presented. First an eigenmode linear stability analysis
   is performed, using the small-gap approximation. The solutions obtained
   give insight into the instability mechanisms and indicate the existence
   of a confined internal gravity wave mode at the onset of instability.
   In the second stability analysis, only diffusion is neglected,
   predicting accurately the instability threshold as well as the critical
   pulsation for all the stratifications used in the experiments.
   Experiments show that the basic, purely azimuthal flow (circular
   Couette flow) is destabilized through a supercritical Hopf bifurcation
   to an oscillatory flow of confined internal gravity waves, in excellent
   agreement with the linear stability analysis. The secondary
   bifurcation, which takes the system to a pattern of drifting
   non-axisymmetric vortices, is a saddle-node bifurcation. The proposed
   bifurcation diagram shows a global bifurcation, and explains the
   discrepancies between previous experimental and numerical results. For
   slightly larger values of the rotation rate, weakly turbulent spectra
   are obtained, indicating an early appearance of weak turbulence:
   stationary structures and defects coexist. Moreover, in this regime,
   there is a large distribution of structure sizes. Visualizations of the
   next regime exhibit constant-wavelength structures and fluid exchange
   between neighbouring cells, similar to wavy vortices. Their existence
   is explained by a simple energy argument.
   The generalization of the bifurcation diagram to hydrodynamic systems
   with one destabilizing and one stabilizing control parameter is
   discussed. A qualitative argument is derived to discriminate between
   oscillatory and stationary onset of instability in the general case.}},

Abstract = {{Marginal convection in the form of Alfven waves in an electrically

   corresponds to undamped Alfven waves propagating between the boundaries

   the Alfven waves against viscous and ohmic damping. The structure of
   the Alfven waves is strongly dependent, even at leading order, on the

Abstract = {{Pattern formation in systems with a conserved quantity is considered by

   leads to a large-scale neutral mode that must be included in the

   bifurcation, the usual Ginzburg-Landau equation for the amplitude of
   the pattern is then coupled to an equation for the large-scale mode.
   These amplitude equations show that for certain parameters all
   roll-type solutions are unstable. This new instability differs from the
   Eckhaus instability in that it is amplitude-driven and is
   supercritical. Beyond the stability boundary, there exist stable
   stationary solutions in the form of strongly modulated patterns. The
   envelope of these modulations is calculated in terms of Jacobi elliptic
   functions and, away from the onset of modulation, is closely
   approximated by a sech profile. Numerical simulations indicate that as

Month = {{MAY 10}},
Abstract = {{Two-dimensional thermal convection in the presence of a strong oblique
   magnetic field is studied using an asymptotic expansion in inverse
   powers of the Chandrasekhar number. The linear stability problem
   reveals the existence of two distinct scales in the vertical structure
   of the critical eigenfunctions: a small length-scale whose vertical
   wavenumber k(z) is comparable with the large horizontal wavenumber
   k(perpendicular to) selected at onset, and a large-scale modulation
   which forms an envelope on the order of the layer depth d. The
   small-scale structure in the vertical results from magnetic alignment
   that forces fluid motions to be (nearly) parallel to the field lines.
   For convective transport in the vertical this constraint must be
   relaxed. This is achieved by molecular dissipation which allows weak
   upward (downward) motions of hot (cold) fluid elements across the field
   lines and results in a large-scale vertical modulation of the magnetic
   columns. Using the scaling suggested by the linear theory, strongly
   nonlinear steady and overstable solutions are constructed. These are
   characterized by large departures of the mean temperature profile from
   the conduction profile. For overstable rolls two modes of convection
   are uncovered. The first `vertical field' mode is characterized by thin
   thermal boundary layers and a Nusselt number that increases rapidly
   with the applied Rayleigh number; this mode is typical of steady
   convection as well. The second or `horizontal field' mode is present in
   overstable convection only and has broad thermal boundary layers and a
   Nusselt number that remains small and approximately independent of the
   Rayleigh number. At large Rayleigh numbers this regime is characterized
   by a piecewise linear temperature profile with a small isothermal core.
   The `horizontal field' mode is favoured for substantial inclinations of
   the field and sufficiently small ohmic diffusivity. The transition
   between the two regimes is typically hysteretic and for fixed
   inclination and diffusivity may occur with increasing Rayleigh number.
   Similar but highly asymmetric states are obtained for depth-dependent
   zeta, where zeta is the ratio of ohmic to thermal diffusivity. These
   results are obtained from a nonlinear eigenvalue problem for the
   Nusselt number and mean temperature profile, and suggest a possible
   explanation for the sharp boundary between the umbra and penumbra in
   sunspots.}},

   the total flux content of the flux tube, but that the angle of
   inclination from the vertical of the field at the edge of the tube
   increases with flux content. In all our calculations, fluid motion
   converges on the flux tube at the surface. The results compare
   favourably with observations of pores; in contrast, large sunspots lie
   at the centre of an out-flowing moat cell. We conjecture that there is
   an inflow hidden beneath the penumbrae of large spots, and that this

   By investigating the stability of a layer of magnetic field embedded

   following: first, that magnetic buoyancy instabilities indeed give rise
   to a mean EMF and, secondly, that the electromotive force is largest in
   the region where the magnetic layer is unstable, i.e. where the field
   strength decreases fastest with height.

Abstract = {{There has been significant progress in the development of numerical
   geodynamo models over the last five years. Advances in computer
   technology have made it possible to perform three-dimensional
   simulations, with thermal or compositional convection as the driving
   mechanism. These numerical simulations give reasonable results for the
   morphology and strength of the field at the core-mantle boundary and
   the models are also capable of giving reversals and excursions which
   can be compared with palaeomagnetic observations; they also predict
   differential rotation between the inner core and the mantle.
   However, there are still a number of fundamental problems associated
   with the simulations, which are proving hard to overcome. Despite tl:le
   advances in computing power, the models are still expensive and take a
   long time to run. This problem may diminish as faster machines become
   available, and new numerical methods exploit parallelization
   effectively, but currently there ase no practical schemes available
   which work at low Ekman number.
   Even with turbulent values of the diffusivities (and the question of
   whether isotropic diffusivities are appropriate is still unresolved),
   the appropriate dynamical regime has not yet been reached. In
   consequence, modelling assumptions about the nature of the flow near
   title boundaries have to be made, and different choices can have

Abstract = {{Fluid motions driven by convection in the Earth's fluid core sustain
   geomagnetic fields by magnetohydrodynamic dynamo processes. The
   dynamics of the core is critically influenced by the combined effects
   of rotation and magnetic fields. This paper attempts to illustrate the
   scale-related difficulties in modelling a, convection-driven geodynamo
   by studying both linear and nonlinear convection in the presence of
   imposed toroidal and poloidal fields. We show that there exist three
   extremely large disparities, as a direct consequence of small viscosity
   and rapid rotation of the Earth's fluid core, in the spatial, temporal
   and amplitude scales of a convection-driven geodynamo. We also show
   that the structure and strength of convective motions, and, hence, the
   relevant dynamo action, are extremely sensitive to title intricate
   dynamical balance between the viscous, Coriolis and Lorentz forces;
   similarly the structure and strength of the magnetic field generated by
   the dynamo process can depend very sensitively on the fluid flow. We
   suggest, therefore,, that the zero Ekman number limit is strongly
   singular and that a stable convection-driven strong-field geodynamo
   satisfying Taylor's constraint may not exist. Instead, the geodynamo
   may vacillate between a strong field state, as at present, and a weak
   field state, which is also unstable because it fails to convect
   sufficient heat.}},

   between steady and oscillatory convection near onset can be explained:
   this extends and completes the work of Clune and Knobloch (Pattern

   ensures that the analysis is relevant to the behaviour which would be
   observed in an unbounded plane layer. The symmetries of the resulting
   D-4 x T-2-equivariant bifurcation problem play a large role in
   determining the bifurcation structure and explain the appearance of
   interesting phenomena such as drifting solutions (A.M. Rucklidge, M.

   cores of the Earth and other planets and satellites, are reviewed.
   While the fluid motions driven by convection generate and sustain
   magnetic fields by magnetohydrodynamic dynamo processes, the pattern
   and strength of the convective motions that control dynamo action are
   critically influenced by the combined and inseparable effects of
   rotation, magnetic fields, and spherical geometry. Emphasis is placed
   on the key dynamic feature of rotating spherical
   magnetohydrodynamics-the interaction between the Coriolis and Lorentz
   forces and the resulting effect on convection and magnetohydrodynamic
   processes. It is shown that the small value of the Ekman number, a
   result of rapid rotation and small viscosity in the fluid parts of
   planetary cores, causes severe difficulties in modeling planetary
   dynamos. There exist huge disparities, as a direct consequence of a
   small Ekman number, in the spatial, temporal, and amplitude scales of a
   convection-driven dynamo. The use of hyperviscosity removes these
   difficulties, but at the same time it alters the key dynamics in a
   fundamental and undesirable way. A convection-driven dynamo solution in

Abstract = {{Recent palaeomagnetic studies suggest that excursions of the
   geomagnetic field, during which the intensity drops suddenly by a
   factor of 5-10 and the local direction changes dramatically, are more
   common than previously expected. The `normal' state of the geomagnetic
   field, dominated by an axial dipole, seems to be interrupted every
   30-100 kyr; it may not therefore be as stable as we thought. We have
   investigated a possible mechanism for the instability of the geodynamo
   by calculating the critical Rayleigh number (R-c) for the onset of
   convection in a rotating spherical shell permeated by an imposed
   magnetic field with both toroidal and poloidal components. We have
   found R-c to be a very sensitive function of the poloidal field at the
   very small Ekman number pertaining to the core. The magnetic Reynolds
   number, and therefore the dynamo action, is equally sensitive to the
   applied field because of its dependence on the difference between the
   Rayleigh number and its critical value. This explains why numerical
   dynamo simulations at small Ekman number fail when similar
   magnetoconvection calculations succeed: the fluctuating magnetic field
   of the dynamo leads to rapid swings in convection strength that cannot
   be resolved numerically. The geodynamo may be unstable for the same
   reason, with the strength of convection varying wildly in response to
   the inevitable small changes in magnetic field. Frequent geomagnetic
   excursions may therefore be a manifestation of the instability arising
   from the core's very weak viscosity and the controlling effects of the
   Earth's rotation.}},

   10(-9) and 10(-17). In the bulk of the core, balance between
   Archimedean and Coriolis forces can be justified in order to determine
   typical hydromagnetic field values and symmetries via E, 1/R << 1 that
   appear as asymptotically small parameters near the highest derivatives

   phi so that only a single, prescribed value of the azimuthal
   wavenumber, m, is included in addition to the axisymmetric (m = 0) part

   is a self-consistent, convectively driven dynamo, capable of
   reproducing qualitatively similar axisymmetric magnetic fields to those
   of a Boussinesq 3D model, but at considerably lower computational
   effort. We have chosen to vary the Rayleigh number, Ra, for m = 2 and m

Abstract = {{Perhaps the most fundamental problem in dynamo theory is the smallness
   of the Ekman number E which is O(10(-15)) based on estimates of the
   molecular diffusivity of the Earth's core, it is difficult to achieve
   values much lower than O(10(-4)) in numerical models. The
   ``headline{''} value of E can be reduced using hyperviscosity but it is
   becoming clear that this is not helping our aim of moving towards the
   geophysically relevant parameter regime of low viscosity, and several
   factors indicate that E = O(10(-4)) is not small enough. The
   magnetostrophic approximation is an alternative approach that neglects
   viscous effects altogether (E = 0) in the interior of the core. A
   consequence of this is Taylor's constraint {[}Taylor, J.B., 1963. The
   magnetohydrodynamics of a rotating fluid and the Earth's dynamo
   problem. Proc. R. Sec. London, Ser. A 274, 274-283]. So far,
   fundamental problems have prevented the successful working of a
   convection-driven dynamo model using this approach {[}Walker, M.R.,
   Barenghi, C.F., Jones, C.A., 1998. A note on dynamo action at
   asymptotically small Ekman number. Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn. 88.
   261-275]. Nevertheless, the difficulties with hyperviscosity mean that
   it is important to continue to learn as much as possible about the E
   --> O limit through the (E = 0) magnetostrophic approximation. If
   viscous effects are retained only in Ekman boundary layers, a standard
   analysis modifies Taylor's constraint to give a prescription for the
   mean azimuthal flow. This so-called ``geostrophic flow{''} V-G(s,
   t)1(phi) is the dominant nonlinear effect when the magnetic field is
   weak and can act to equilibrate an otherwise exponentially growing
   linear solution in an ``Ekman state{''}. Two variants of this approach
   have been studied: mean-field dynamos and magnetoconvection. Here, we
   consider the latter. We use a cylindrical geometry {[}adopting
   cylindrical polars (s, phi, t)]. In the presence of an imposed magnetic
   field B-0, we time-step the governing equations to find the dependence
   of the nonlinear (Ekman state) solutions as a function of the Rayleigh
   number Ra. We investigate the role of alternative magnetic boundary
   conditions and of whether there is an inner cylindrical boundary or
   not. These introduce modest quantitative differences. The major
   qualitative difference arises from the orientation of gravity g and the
   imposed temperature gradient del T. When in the axial (z) direction, a
   transition towards a Taylor state (along the lines envisaged by Malkus
   and Proctor {[}Malkus, W.V.R., Proctor, M.R.E., 1975. The macrodynamics
   of alpha-effect dynamos in rotating fluids. J. Fluid Mech. 67,
   417-443.]) is found at Ra close to Ra-c. When g and del T-0 are aligned
   in the radial (s) direction, supercritical Ekman states are found for a
   large range of values of Ra, and there is no evidence of the system
   moving towards a Taylor state. These results are consistent with the
   earlier work of Skinner and Soward {[}Skinner, P.H., Soward, A.M.,
   1990. Convection in a rotating magnetic system and Taylor's constraint
   II. Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid Dyn. 60, 335-356.] and Jones and Roberts
   {[}Jones, C,A., Roberts, P.H., 1990. Magnetoconvection in rapidly
   rotating Boussinesq and compressible fluids. Geophys. Astrophys. Fluid
   Dyn. 55, 263-308]. The expected cancellation in the Taylor integral is
   clearly observed as a Taylor state is approached. This emphasises the
   inability of the standard prescription for V-G to be useful other than
   for an Ekman state. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   kinetic and magnetic energy drops by more than two orders of magnitude
   from the spectral peak to the cut-off, although the basic features are
   still captured at lower resolution. With few exceptions we obtain
   dipole-dominated magnetic fields. The dynamos operate in the
   strong-field regime where Lorentz and Coriolis forces are of similar
   order. The critical magnetic Reynolds number for self-sustained dynamos
   is of order Rm = 50. However, we also find that the field can die away
   when Rm is too large. The minimum magnetic Prandtl number at which we
   find dynamo action depends on the Ekman number to the 3/4 power.
   Dynamos at E = 10(-3) are subcritical whereas those at E = 10(-4) are
   generally supercritical. The presence of the magnetic field tends to
   break the equatorial symmetry of the flow and favours convection inside
   the inner core tangent cylinder. With stress-free boundaries, dynamo
   action suppresses the axisymmetric azimuthal wind that dominates in
   non-magnetic convection. The field morphology is broadly similar for
   both kinds of boundary conditions. When low-pass filtered, several
   models exhibit field structures that resemble the geomagnetic field at
   the core-mantle boundary to a surprising degree.}},

Abstract = {{The need to satisfy Taylor's constraint is probably the single most
   important constraint on the dynamics of planetary magnetic fields. We
   point out that the adjustment to Taylor's constraint is considerably
   more difficult in the Galilean moons of Jupiter than in the Earth,
   e.g., simply due to the presence of the ambient Jovian field. In
   particular, if the ambient field is of sufficient strength, weak field
   solutions are disallowed. The `default option' of falling back to an
   Ekman state, if Taylor' s constraint cannot be satisfied in any other
   way, is therefore no longer available. The magnetic field must
   therefore be in a Taylor state, a model-Z state, or something else
   entirely, but it cannot be in an Ekman state. In this work, we present
   a simple model of magnetoconvection specifically designed to explore
   this adjustment to Taylor's constraint in the Limit of vanishing
   viscosity, in the presence of an ambient field. We find that for a weak
   imposed thermal wind, the system approaches a Taylor state as the
   strength of the ambient field is increased. Strong thermal wind
   solutions behave in a very different manner. Initially, as the ambient
   field strength is increased, the system exhibits many features,
   indicating that a Taylor state is being approached. However, it never
   reaches a Taylor state, evolving instead to a model-Z state as the
   ambient field strength is increased yet further. (C) 1999 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to suggest an interaction mechanism for
   the influence of static magnetic fields on electrochemical processes
   occurring at a ferromagnetic electrode immersed in a paramagnetic
   electrolytic solution. The hypothesis is that the magnetic field will
   cause a transport of all ions due to the difference in the magnetic
   susceptibility in the solution at the electrode surface. The ion
   transport induced by the magnetic field is directed from electrode into
   solution, Experimentally, the effects of static magnetic fields on
   electrochemical systems were observed only within systems consisting of
   ferromagnetic electrodes immersed in paramagnetic solutions. The
   results showed that the magnetic field caused an anodic polarization
   for the ferric/ferrous system and a cathodic polarization for the
   nickel/nickel-ion and the cobalt/cobalt-ion system. The results were
   obtained by the open-circuit potential and the
   Dotentiostatic/galvanostatic methods. The suggested interaction
   mechanism is magnetoconvection, which predicts that to obtain any
   magnetic field effect, there has to exist a gradient of paramagnetic
   ion concentration in the solution at the electrode surface.
   Theoretically, it is shown that the magnetic field tends to cause an
   additional convective transfer of all components of the solution, which
   will be generated in the vicinity of the electrode surface, Further,
   both the experimental results and the suggested mechanism show that the
   magnetic field effect increases with increasing magnetic flux density
   and magnetic susceptibility of the solution and decreases with
   increasing temperature and stirring rate. The evidence presented here
   show that the proposed hypothesis and the proposed interaction

Abstract = {{Highly nonlinear buoyant convection is investigated analytically under
   conditions typically encountered in the liquid cores of planets in the

   Rayleigh number) and ultrafast rotation (small Ekman number) typical of
   such flows, diffusion and viscosity act only in layers that are
   asymptotically thin in comparison with the radius of the core. These
   boundary layers control the buoyancy, the large-scale velocity, and the
   magnetic field observed at the planetary surface. The interchange of
   the internal layers determines the small-scale (unobservable) fields
   and the prevailing symmetry of the large-scale magnetic fields. It is
   proved for the first time that axisymmetric azimuthal flows dominate at
   large scales, while convection cells elongated parallel to the axis of
   rotation dominate at small scales. A system of equations is derived
   which is optimum for describing magnetoconvection of planetary cores on

Abstract = {{The anelastic approximation has strong advantages for numerical
   simulations of stellar and solar convection zones. The chief and
   generally known one is that it suppresses acoustic modes, permitting
   larger simulated time steps to be taken than would be possible in a
   fully compressible model. This paper clarifies and extends previous
   work on the anelastic approximation by presenting a new vorticity-based
   formulation that can be used for two- and three-dimensional MHD
   simulations. In the new formulation, all fluctuating thermodynamic
   variables except the entropy are eliminated from the equations. This
   shows in the plainest way how the anelastic approximation generalizes
   the Boussinesq approximation, which appears as a special limit. The
   roots of both models are traced to the mixing-length theory of
   convection, which establishes the scaling parameters for ``deep{''}
   (weakly superadiabatic) convection at low Mach numbers. The Ogura \&
   Phillips and the Glatzmaier derivations of the anelastic model are
   broadened to include a possible depth dependence in the thermodynamic
   properties of constituent gases. This permits a variable state of gas
   ionization, for example, which is important for stars like the Sun, in
   which the convecting regions coincide with the ionization zones of
   hydrogen and helium. Tests with the new model are presented, in which
   it is shown that the new model is capable of reproducing earlier
   results in the linear and nonlinear stages of convection.}},

   in a rotating, electrically conducting spherical shell are analyzed. We
   find two regimes of nonreversing, strong field dynamos at Ekman number
   10(-4) and Rayleigh numbers up to 11 times critical. In the strongly
   columnar regime, convection occurs only in the fluid exterior to the
   inner core tangent cylinder, in the form of narrow columnar vortices
   elongated parallel to the spin axis. Columnar convection contains large
   amounts of negative helicity in the northern hemisphere and positive
   helicity in the southern hemisphere and results in dynamo action above
   a certain Rayleigh number, through a macroscopic alpha(2) mechanism.
   These dynamos equilibrate by generating concentrated magnetic flux
   bundles that limit the kinetic energy of the convection columns. The
   dipole-dominated external field is formed by superposition of several
   flux bundles at middle and high latitudes. At low latitudes a pattern
   of reversed flux patches propagates in the retrograde direction,
   resulting in an apparent westward drift of the field in the equatorial
   region. At higher Rayleigh number we find a fully developed regime with
   convection inside the tangent cylinder consisting of polar upwelling
   and azimuthal thermal wind flows. These motions modify the dynamo by
   expelling poloidal flux from the poles and generating intense toroidal
   fields in the polar regions near the inner core. Convective dynamos in
   the fully developed regime exhibit characteristics that can be compared
   with the geomagnetic field, including concentrated flux bundles on the
   core-mantle boundary, polar minima in field intensity, and episodes of

Abstract = {{Fully nonlinear three-dimensional convection in a strong vertical

   temperature profile only. As a result all steady spatially periodic
   patterns have the same Nusselt numbers and mean temperature profile, A
   similar degeneracy is present in overstable convection with all
   periodic patterns having identical time-averaged Nusselt numbers and

Abstract = {{Convective motions in the Earth's fluid core are strongly affected by a
   combination of the Coriolis and magnetic forces. For a long-timescale
   phenomenon such as the geomagnetic reversals, the Earth's magnetic

   phenomenon such as the secular variation, dynamics of the Earth's fluid
   core can be understood by examining convective motions in the presence
   of an imposed magnetic field without involving the complex dynamo
   processes. The present paper investigates both linear and nonlinear
   convection in a rapidly rotating fluid spherical shell like the Earth's
   fluid core in the presence of a strong axisymmetric toroidal magnetic
   field with dipole symmetry. In our linear calculation, it is
   demonstrated that magnetoconvection is nearly independent of the Ekman

   solution bifurcating from the onset of magnetoconvection corresponds to
   steadily travelling magnetoconvection waves with equatorial and
   azimuthal symmetries. The secondary solution after the instability of

Abstract = {{General principles for developing physically sound low-order models in
   fluid dynamics are discussed. It is shown that low-order models with
   energy conserving properties of the original equations that arise in
   various important problems (Rayleigh-Benard convection, rotating fluid,
   magnetohydrodynamic convection) may be presented in the form of coupled
   three-mode systems known in mechanics as Volterra gyrostats (plus terms
   describing forcing and friction). When these models are expanded by
   increasing the order of approximation or by adding new physical
   mechanisms. they still have the structure of coupled gyrostats.
   Conversely, when a low-order model cannot be transformed into coupled
   gyrostats, this may indicate that its conservation properties should be
   questioned. For instance, while the widely used (in convection studies)
   Howard-Krishnamurti model {[}J. Fluid Mech. 170, 385 (1986)] is not
   energy conserving and does not have a gyrostatic form, its simple
   extension to a system of coupled gyrostats possesses inviscid energy
   invariants. Integrals of motion in the fluid are shown to have their
   analogs in systems of coupled gyrostats. Thus, giving low-order models
   a gyrostatic structure ensures that certain important physics from the
   original fluid dynamical equations is retained. Finally, this approach
   is used to develop a coupled gyrostat model of turbulence that exhibits
