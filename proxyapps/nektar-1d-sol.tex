\section{Nektar-1D-SOL}
One-dimensional model of the scrape-off layer (SOL).  Written in Nektar++, it illustrates the implementation of a new
 Nektar++ solver based on existing solver types for unsteady advection problems.

The outputs can be compared with those described in Section 4 of the internal report \cite{y3re222}, which were 
obtained using an alternative PDE solver.

Nektar-1D-SOL is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/ExCALIBUR-NEPTUNE/nektar-1d-sol}.
