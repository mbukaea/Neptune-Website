abstract = {Highly variable flux surface averaged heat fluxes are resolved in 
gyrokinetic simulations of ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence, even in 
large systems. Radially propagating fronts or avalanches are also seen. Their 
propagation lengths in gyroradii and relative amplitude remain constant as 
simulation size is increased, so the avalanches appear to result from local 
dynamics, rather than global relaxation events. For the Cyclone [Dimits et al., 
Phys. Plasmas 7, 969 (2000)] case, the avalanche propagation direction is found 
to depend on the sign of the shearing rate. A mechanism for avalanche 
propagation based on the advection of turbulence tilted by the shear flows is 
proposed: The Cyclone linear ITG dispersion relation explains the propagation 
direction of tilted vortices. It also explains why there is no such preferred 
direction in a simulation with reduced magnetic shear. The paper explores 
several models for these bursts. First, certain types of models based on 
nonlinear heat diffusion equations are ruled out. A different type of 
one-dimensional (1D) model, introduced in Benkadda et al., [Nucl. Fusion 41, 
995 (2001)], yields much better qualitative and quantitative agreement. 
However, the 1D model cannot explain the directionality of the bursts, even 
though it includes the features typically considered important for burst 
propagation. A symmetry-breaking term is necessary. An additional term is 
included to reproduce the wave dispersion with respect to radial wavenumber, 
and this is shown to be sufficient to reproduce the favored direction for burst 
propagation.},

toroidal device, the Coriolis drift associated with the background plasma 
rotation significantly affects the small scale instabilities [A. G. Peeters et

effect of the Coriolis drift on toroidal momentum transport is extended in the

gyrokinetic flux-tube code GKW [A. G. Peeters and D. Strintzi, Phys. Plasmas 
11, 3748 (2004)], and supported analytically, that the Coriolis drift and the 
parallel dynamics play a similar role in the coupling of density, temperature, 
and velocity perturbations. The effect on particle and heat fluxes increases 
with the toroidal rotation (directly) and with the toroidal rotation gradient 
(through the parallel mode structure), depends on the direction of propagation 
of the perturbation, increases with the impurity charge number and with the 
impurity mass to charge number ratio. The case of very high toroidal rotation, 
relevant to spherical tokamaks, is investigated by including the effect of the 
centrifugal force in a fluid model. The main effect of the centrifugal force is 
to decrease the local density gradient at the low field side midplane and to 
add an extra contribution to the fluxes. The conditions for which the inertial

enhance both spatial and temporal reuse. Experimental results show that these 
changes improve execution time by more than 20% on large parallel systems,

This model assumes that (for constant density) the electric field is determined 
by its balance with the pressure gradient. In the framework of this model the 
influence of a neoclassical electric field on growth rate and structure of ITG 
instabilities is investigated for the two stellarator configurations. In order 
to carry out nonlinear simulations the field equation has to be modified such 
that it contains the flux surface average of the electrostatic perturbation. 
Since especially for three-dimensional configurations the corresponding matrix 
is no longer a sparse one, a scheme is presented which uses a matrix-free 
approach for the averaging operator.},

abstract = {Excitation of Alfven eigenmode by energetic ions has been attracted 
considerable attentions both experimentally and theoretically, since it may 
lead to loss of energetic ions, damage of first walls, and benefit as a tool 
for reconstructing the magnetic field structure. Numerous computational 
analyses of Alfven eigenmode have been carried out with various MHD models and 
gyrokinetic models to predict the mode frequency and the growth rate. Previous 
gyrokinetic analyses, however, assume Maxwellian or slowing-down velocity 
distribution functions for the energetic ions. In a plasma heated by ICRF 
waves, neutral beam injection (NBI), or alpha particles produced by fusion 
reaction, the velocity distribution function of energetic ions is far from the 
Maxwellian. Therefore quantitative analyses of Alfven eigenmodes require to 
include the effect of non-Maxwellian velocity distribution function. In this 
article, we report gyrokinetic full-wave analyses of the Alfven eigenmodes with 
realistic velocity distribution functions. We employ the integrated modeling 
code TASK/3D for tokamak plasmas and toroidal helical plasmas. The velocity 
distribution function of the energetic ion species is calculated by the 
Fokker-Planck module, TASK/FP. The gyrokinetic dielectric tensor is evaluated 
for arbitrary distribution function by the wave dispersion module, TASK/DP. The 
wave structure of the Alfven eigenmode is computed by the newly- updated full 
wave module, TASK/WM. The TASK/WM module now uses the finite element method in 
the radial direction and calculate the wave electric field in the local 
orthogonal coordinates. Maxwell's equation with gyrokinetic dielectric tensor 
is solved in the magnetic surface coordinates and the fast Fourier transform in 
used in the poloidal and toroidal directions. We look for a complex eigen 
frequency which maximizes the volume integral of the square of the wave 
electric field amplitude for fixed excitation proportional to the electron 
density. First we compare the mode frequency and damping rate of the toroidal 
Alfven eigenmode in a tokamak plasma with the Maxwellian without and with the 
effect of ion precession frequency. Next the effects of modified velocity 
distribution functions for ions heated by ICRF, NBI and alpha particles will be 
studied in the reversed magnetic shear configuration. Finally the toroidal and 
global Alfven eigenmodes in LHD plasmas will be reported.},

weakly collisional magnetized plasmas. A cascade model is presented, based on 
the assumptions of local nonlinear energy transfer in wave number space, 
critical balance between linear propagation and nonlinear interaction times, 
and the applicability of linear dissipation rates for the nonlinearly turbulent 
plasma. The model follows the nonlinear cascade of energy from the driving 
scale in the MHD regime, through the transition at the ion Larmor radius into 
the kinetic Alfven wave regime, in which the turbulence is dissipated by 
kinetic processes. The turbulent fluctuations remain at frequencies below the 
ion cyclotron frequency due to the strong anisotropy of the turbulent 
fluctuations, k|| &Lt; k<sub>&perp;</sub> (implied by critical balance). In 
this limit, the turbulence is optimally described by gyrokinetics; it is shown 
that the gyrokinetic approximation is well satisfied for typical slow solar 
wind parameters. Wave phase velocity measurements are consistent with a kinetic 
Alfven wave cascade and not the onset of ion cyclotron damping. The conditions 
under which the gyrokinetic cascade reaches the ion cyclotron frequency are 
established. Cascade model solutions imply that collisionless damping provides 
a natural explanation for the observed range of spectral indices in the 
dissipation range of the solar wind. The dissipation range spectrum is 
predicted to be an exponential fall off; the power-law behavior apparent in 
observations may be an artifact of limited instrumental sensitivity. The 
cascade model is motivated by a program of gyrokinetic simulations of

kinetic plasma turbulence as a generalized form of energy cascade in phase 
space. It is emphasized that conversion of turbulent energy into thermodynamic 
heat is only achievable in the presence of some (however small) degree of 
collisionality. The smallness of the collision rate is compensated for by the 
emergence of a small-scale structure in the velocity space. For gyrokinetic 
turbulence, a nonlinear perpendicular phase-mixing mechanism is identified and 
described as a turbulent cascade of entropy fluctuations simultaneously 
occurring at spatial scales smaller than the ion gyroscale and in velocity 
space. Scaling relations for the resulting fluctuation spectra are derived. An 
estimate for the collisional cutoff is provided. The importance of adequately 
modelling and resolving collisions in gyrokinetic simulations is briefly 
discussed, as well as the relevance of these results to understanding the 
dissipation-range turbulence in the solar wind and the electrostatic 
microturbulence in fusion plasmas.},

been used to measure local, turbulent fluctuations of the electron temperature 
in the core of DIII-D plasmas. This paper describes the hardware and testing of 
the CECE diagnostic and highlights the importance of measurements of multifield 
fluctuation profiles for the testing and validation of nonlinear gyrokinetic 
codes. The process of testing and validating such codes is critical for 
extrapolation to next-step fusion devices. For the first time, the radial 
profiles of electron temperature and density fluctuations are compared to 
nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. The CECE diagnostic at DIII-D uses 
correlation radiometry to measure the rms amplitude and spectrum of the 
electron temperature fluctuations. Gaussian optics are used to produce a 
poloidal spot size with w<sub>o</sub>~1.75 cm in the plasma. The intermediate 
frequency filters and the natural linewidth of the EC emission determine the 
radial resolution of the CECE diagnostic, which can be less than 1 cm. 
Wavenumbers resolved by the CECE diagnostic are k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&les;1.8 
cm<sup>-1</sup> and k<sub>r</sub>&les;4 cm<sup>-1</sup>, relevant for studies 
of long-wavelength turbulence associated with the trapped electron mode and the

electron temperature fluctuations in the region 0.5&lt;r/a&lt;0.9, increase 
with radius from ~0.5% to ~2%, similar to density fluctuations that are 
measured simultaneously with beam emission spectroscopy. After incorporating 
&ldquo;synthetic diagnostics&rdquo; to effectively filter the code output, the 
simulations reproduce the characteristics of the turbulence and transport at 
one radial location r/a=0.5, but not at a second location, r/a=0.75. These 
results illustrate that measurements of the profiles of multiple fluctuating 
fields can provide a significant constraint on the turbulence models employed

abstract = {The &beta; scaling of micro-instabilities has been investigated by 
several authors using gyrofluid or gyrokinetic description in linear as well as 
in non-linear calculations. The typical picture well established now is that at 
low &beta;, Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) mode is stabilized with increasing 
&beta; until Kinetic Ballooning modes become unstable. Such kind of numerical 
studies have been generally performed in plasma conditions close to the CYCLONE 
case, which means for ion temperature gradient length strongly above the ITG 
linear threshold and density gradient length around R/L <sub>n</sub> = 2.2. 
However, in some standard H-mode plasmas, not only the ion temperature gradient 
length is closer to the ITG threshold but also the density gradient length can 
be rather small as compared to the CYCLONE case. In these conditions, the 
&beta; scaling of micro-instabilities can significantly differ from the 
expected behavior described above. The goal of this paper is to investigate 
numerically the &beta; scaling of micro-instabilities around such experimental 
conditions. Simulations have been performed using the gyrokinetic 
electromagnetic flux-tube code GS2 in its linear version and considering as 
reference, discharges from the dedicated &beta; scaling experiments performed 
recently in ASDEX Upgrade. The effect of changing the gradient lengths (density 
and temperature) within experimental errors-bars is studied. It appears that 
for certain ranges of plasma parameters micro-tearing modes are the dominant 
micro-instability and coexist in the spectrum with ITG modes with a comparable 
growth rate. The effect of the plasma shape on the &beta; scaling of 
micro-instabilities is also investigated. It is shown that the triangularity 
affects slightly the KBM branch which is destabilized at value of &beta; 
clearly above the experimental range. However, it is found that at 
p<sub>t</sub> = 0.7 Trapped Electron Modes are the most unstable instabilities 
and that such modes are destabilized with increasing &beta; in agreement with 
results from dedicated &beta;experiment performed in ASDEX Upgrade.},

non-dissipative conservative finite difference scheme. The scheme guarantees 
numerical stability by satisfying relevant first principles in the modern

abstract = {Chip multiprocessors (CMP) are widely used for high performance 
computing. Further, these CMPs are being configured in a hierarchical manner to 
compose a node in a cluster system. A major challenge to be addressed is 
efficient use of such cluster systems for large-scale scientific applications. 
In this paper, we quantify the performance gap resulting from using different 
number of processors per node; this information is used to provide a baseline 
for the amount of optimization needed when using all processors per node on CMP 
clusters. We conduct detailed performance analysis to identify how applications 
can be modified to efficiently utilize all processors per node on CMP clusters, 
especially focusing on two scientific applications: a 3D particle-in-cell, 
magnetic fusion application gyrokinetic toroidal code (GTC) and a lattice 
Boltzmann method for simulating fluid dynamics (LBM). In terms of refinements, 
we use conventional techniques such as cache blocking, loop unrolling and loop 
fusion, and develop hybrid methods for optimizing MPI_Allreduce and MPI_Reduce. 
Using these optimizations, the application performance for utilizing all 
processors per node was improved by up to 18.97% for GTC and 15.77% for LBM on 
up to 2048 total processors on the CMP clusters.},

inward transport due to ITG modes is caused mainly by magnetic curvature and

the plasma is far from marginal stability. However, if the plasma is close to 
marginal stability, collisions may even enhance the inward transport. The sign 
and the magnitude of the transport are sensitive to the form of the collision 
operator, to the magnetic drift normalized to the real frequency of the mode, 
and to the density and temperature scale lengths. These analytical results are 
in agreement with previously published gyrokinetic simulations. Unlike the 
ITG-driven flux, the TEM-driven flux is expected to be outwards for conditions 
far from marginal stability and inwards otherwise.},

to be unstable within the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) region (in s&circ;-&alpha;

In this work we verify this result using the gyrokinetic code GS2 
[Kotschenreuther et al., Comput. Phys. Commun. 88, 128 (1996)] treating both 
ions and electrons as kinetic species and retaining the magnetosonic 
perturbation B<sub>&par;</sub>. Growth rates calculated using GS2 differ 
significantly from the previous differential/shooting code analysis. 
Calculations without B<sub>&par;</sub> find the stability region is preserved, 
while the addition of B<sub>&par;</sub> causes the mode to be more unstable 
than previously calculated within the region of MHD second stability. The 
inclusion of parallel ion current and B<sub>&par;</sub> into the shooting code 
does not account for the GS2 results. The evidence presented in this paper 
leads us to the conclusion that the adiabatic electron approximation employed 
in previous studies is found to be unsuitable for this type of instability. 
Based on the findings of this work, the KBM becomes an interesting instability

abstract = {The energy confinement time in controlled-fusion devices is 
governed by the turbulent evolution of low-frequency electromagnetic 
fluctuations of nonuniform magnetized plasmas. The necessary kinetic 
calculation of turbulent transport consumes much more computer resources than 
fluid simulations. An alternative approach is based on water-bag-like weak 
solution of collisionless kinetic equations, allowing to reduce the Vlasov 
equation into a set of hydrodynamic equations while keeping its kinetic 
behaviour. In this paper we apply this concept to gyrokinetic modeling, and 
focus on the weak turbulence theory of the gyro-water-bag model. As a result we 
obtain a set of nonlinear diffusion equations where the source terms are the 
divergence of the parallel fluctuating Reynolds stress of each bag. These 
source terms describe the process of correlated radial scattering and parallel 
acceleration which is required to generate a sheared parallel flow and may have 
important consequences for the theory of both intrinsic rotation and momentum 
transport bifurcations which are closely related to confinement improvements 
and internal transport barrier dynamics in tokamaks. Using the kinetic 
resonance condition our quasilinear equations can be recast in a model whose 
the mathematical structure is the same as the famous Keller-Segel model, widely 
used in chemotaxis to describe the collective transport (diffusion and 
aggregation) of cells attracted by a self-emitted chemical substance. Therefore 
the second result of the paper is the derivation of a set of reaction-diffusion 
equations which describes the interplay between the turbulence process in the 
radial direction and the back reaction of the zonal flow in the poloidal 
direction.},

TGLF has comprehensive physics to approximate the turbulent transport due to 
drift-ballooning modes in tokamaks. The TGLF model is a next generation 
gyro-Landau-fluid model that improves the accuracy of the trapped particle 
response and the finite Larmor radius effects compared to its predecessor, 
GLF23. The model solves for the linear eigenmodes of trapped ion and electron 
modes, ion and electron temperature gradient modes, and electromagnetic kinetic 
ballooning modes in either shifted circle or shaped geometry. A database of 
over 400 nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations using the GYRO code has been 
created. A subset of 83 simulations with shaped geometry has been used to find 
a model for the saturation levels. Using a simple quasilinear (QL) saturation 
rule, remarkable agreement with the energy and particle fluxes from a wide 
variety of GYRO simulations is found for both shaped or circular geometry and 
also for low aspect ratio. Using this new QL saturation rule along with a new 
E&times;B shear quench rule for shaped geometry, the density and temperature 
profiles have been predicted in over 500 transport code runs and the results 
compared against experimental data from 96 tokamak discharges. Compared to 
GLF23, the TGLF model demonstrates better agreement between the predicted and 
experimental temperature profiles. Surprisingly, TGLF predicts that the high-k 
modes are found to play an important role in the central core region of low and 
high confinement plasmas lacking transport barriers.},

various types of microinstabilities, which are usually considered as strictly 
separated, can actually be transformed into each other via continuous 
variations of the plasma parameters. This behavior can be explained in terms of 
so-called exceptional points, which have their origin in the non-Hermiticity of 
the linear gyrokinetic operator and also occur in many other branches of 
physics. As a consequence, in large regions of parameter space, the designation 
of unstable modes should be done very carefully or even be avoided altogether.},

turbulence to reach a quasisteady state, and quantitative predictions about the

particular, global particle-in-cell gyrokinetic simulations have been 
inefficient for long simulations due to the accumulation of noise. It is 
demonstrated that a simple Krook operator can effectively control noise; it 
also introduces an unphysical dissipation, which damps the zonal flows and can 
significantly affect simulation results even when the relaxation time is very 
long. However, it is possible to project out the effects of the Krook operator 
on the zonal flows. This permits noise accumulation to be controlled while 
preserving the physics of interest; simulations are then run to determine the

claim of different final states. In fact, a long transient with very different

on flux surfaces, a large-scale sheared electric potential develops on short

predict analytically (i) the temporal dynamics at short times of this electric 
potential, (ii) its poloidal structure, and (iii) its saturation time. All 
agree well with numerical simulations using the GYSELA code. The impact on the 
transport is twofold, as compared to the canonical initial state, where f only 
depends on the motion invariants: (i) the turbulence is delayed due to a weaker 
effective growth rate, (ii) the same transport level is obtained at long times 
and the turbulence exhibits nearly identical statistical characteristics. In 
agreement, the electric potential of these two cases has the same magnitude

interest in experimental studies on impurity transport and more especially a 
comparison of its parametric dependences with theoretical predictions. In this

the central impurity confinement time &tau;imp with increasing Z in the range 
explored (from 13 up to 32). This result is in contradiction to both 
neoclassical and turbulent theoretical predictions. An analysis with the 1D 
impurity transport code ITC shows the existence of a central zone with reduced 
diffusion and indication of an inward convection. These results are completed 
with theoretical simulations of neoclassical transport (NCLASS) and turbulent 
transport with the quasilinear gyrokinetic QuaLiKiz and nonlinear gyrofluid TRB 
models. These simulations do not provide an explanation of the confinement time 
dependence on the impurity charge. Transport outside r/a = 0.3 is well 
described by the nonlinear turbulent calculations but the central region is 
predicted to be below the turbulence threshold while the observed transport is 
one order of magnitude higher than neoclassical values. The gyrokinetic 
calculations evidence the dominant role of the curvature pinch in the total 
convective flux. This term is directed inwards and only weakly dependent on the 
impurity charge in the explored range of species.},

plasmas requires to solve kinetic (or more precisely gyrokinetic) equations. In 
spite of considerable progress, several pending issues remain; although more 
accurate, the kinetic calculation of turbulent transport is much more demanding 
in computer resources than fluid simulations. An alternative approach is based 
on a water bag representation of the distribution function which is not an 
approximation but rather a special class of initial conditions allowing to 
reduce the full kinetic Vlasov equation into a set of hydrodynamic equations 
while keeping its kinetic character. This model has been applied to gyrokinetic 
modelling with very encouraging results. The instability threshold for ITG 
instability is found to be very close to the results obtained from continuous 
Maxwellian distribution, even for only 10 bags. [All rights reserved

function in full-f gyrokinetic codes such as Gysela 5d, aiming at predicting 
the turbulent transport level in low collisional tokamak plasmas. It is found, 
both analytically and numerically, that a Maxwellian distribution function with 
constant profiles on magnetic flux surfaces leads to the fast generation of a 
large scale electric field. Such a field opposes the up-down charge separation 
governed by the inhomogeneity of the equilibrium magnetic field. If large 
enough, the shearing rate induced by the resulting poloidal E&times;B velocity 
could efficiently reduce the plasma micro-instabilities which account for the 
development of the turbulence. Starting in the ab initio code Gysela 5d from an 
equilibrium distribution function depending on motion invariants only is shown 
to cure such a problem. In this case, charge separation is counter-balanced by 
parallel flow, and the standard fluid force balance is recovered. [All rights

importance since it limits the fusion performance of proposed reactor concepts. 
Electron temperature gradient driven (ETG) modes have been proposed as a source 
of anomalous electron thermal loses in tokamaks. It is widely acknowledged that 
the electrostatic potential in ETG turbulence can develop into radially 
elongated structures known as streamers. Understanding the conditions that 
permit streamers to produce experimentally significant transport is a topic of 
great interest. Analysis of the ETG mode at long wavelengths where both the 
ions and electrons are adiabatic (have a Boltzmann response) show that the ETG 
mode is inherently electromagnetic. Mixing length estimates of the thermal 
transport coefficient in this regime peak at collisionless skin-depth scales, 
providing a possible &beta; (the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure) 
dependence of the resulting transport. Preliminary nonlinear flux-tube 
simulations of the electromagnetic ETG mode produce large transport from the 
magnetic nonlinearity, while streamers in the electrostatic potential are still 
formed.},

the region near the magnetic axis in which toroidal drift modes are stable, 
allowing the Ware pinch to peak the density profile. Experimental evidence 
shows that shifting the ICRF resonance off-axis results in a local flattening

temperature profiles support this experimentally observed trend. Stability 
analysis of ion temperature gradient (ITG) and electron temperature gradient 
modes at times before ITB formation is done using the linear gyrokinetic code

abstract = {A sheath layer in a magnetized collisionless plasma is analyzed by 
the one-dimensional kinetic equation. The plasma is bounded by an absorbing 
wall and a plasma source with a shifted Maxwellian velocity distribution 
function that is characterized by a temperature, a drifting velocity parallel 
to the magnetic field, and a cutoff velocity. The magnetic field is assumed to 
be strong enough so that the ion Larmor radius is comparable to the Debye 
length. In order to include the polarization effect of ions due to a strong 
electric field, equations describing the potential profile are derived from the 
gyrokinetic Vlasov equation in a frame moving with the <b>E</b>&times;<b>B</b> 
drift. A new algorithm for evaluating the loss of particles in gyration at the 
wall is introduced. The condition of the stable sheath formation for a 
magnetized plasma is discussed. The dependence of the electric field at the 
wall on the angle and the strength of the magnetic field is examined and 
compared with the results of full-kinetic particle-in-cell simulation. The 
effect of the polarization and the loss of gyration particles on the wall 
electric field are also discussed.},

methods are discussed in the context of their ability to simulate macroscopic 
plasma evolution on an MHD evolution time scale with microturbulence in

equilibrium, it is important to use full-f gyrokinetic calculation with 
sufficient accuracy for perpendicular viscosity. Similarly in MHD problems, a 
good accuracy in constructing the closures, in particular for the viscosity 
stress elements, is required. Although evidence of spontaneous reduction of 
transport with the consequent rapid steepening of the pressure gradient is 
found in simulations with full-f 5D gyrokinetic and 3D Braginskii fluid 
equations, no simulation of the transport barrier formation in agreement with 
experimental observations has yet been presented. For a comprehensive 
description of edge plasma dynamics, including L-H transition, pedestal 
formation, and ELM oscillation problems, full-f 5D gyrokinetic simulation is a 
necessity, at least in hybrid with 3D MHD. With present-day computers, the

scans were performed around several reference cases in the local, 
electrostatic, collisionless limit. Using a parameterized local equilibrium 
model for shaped geometry, the GYRO simulations show that elongation &kappa;

gradient (ITG) and trapped electron mode (TEM) instabilities at fixed midplane 
minor radius. For scans around a reference set of parameters, the GYRO ion 
energy diffusivity, in gyro-Bohm units, approximately follows a 
&kappa;<sup>-1</sup> scaling which is qualitatively similar to recent 
experimental energy confinement scalings. Most of the &kappa; scaling is due to 
the shear in the elongation rather than the local &kappa; itself. The &kappa; 
scaling for the electrons is found to vary and can be stronger or weaker than 
&kappa;<sup>-1</sup> depending on the wavenumber where the transport peaks. The 
&kappa; scaling is weaker when the energy diffusivity peaks at low wavenumbers 
and is stronger when the peak occurs at high wavenumbers. The simulations also 
demonstrate a nonlinear upshift in the critical temperature gradient as the 
elongation increases due to an increase in the residual zonal flow amplitude. 
Triangularity is found to be slightly destabilizing and its effect is strongest 
for highly elongated plasmas. Finally, we find less E&times;B shear is needed 
to quench the transport at high elongation and low aspect ratio. A new linear

abstract = {In the last decade, it became clear that electromagnetic 
(gyro)kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations are very demanding in respect 
to numerical methods and the number of markers used. The Monte Carlo 
discretization of the gyrokinetic equations leads to a severe signal-to-noise 
problem: the statistical representation of the physically irrelevant but 
numerically dominant adiabatic current causing a high statistical noise level. 
The corresponding inaccuracy problem is very pronounced at high plasma &beta; 
and/or small perpendicular wave numbers k&perp;. We derive several numerical 
schemes to overcome the problem using an adjustable control variates method 
which adapts to the dominant adiabatic part of the gyro-center distribution 
function. We have found that the inaccuracy problem is also present in the 
quasi-neutrality equation as a consequence of the p&par;-formulation [T.S. 
Hahm, W.W. Lee, A. Brizard, Nonlinear gyrokinetic theory for finite-beta 
plasmas, Phys. Fluids 31 (1988) 1940]. For slab simulations in the 
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) limit k&perp;&rarr;0, the number of markers can be 
reduced by more than four orders of magnitude compared to a conventional 
&delta;f scheme.The derived schemes represent first steps on a road to fully 
adaptive control variates method which can significantly reduce the inherent 
statistical noise of PIC codes. [All rights reserved Elsevier].},

abstract = {The impact of plasma shaping on electron heat transport is 
investigated in TCV L-mode plasmas. The study is motivated by the observation 
of an increase in the energy confinement time with decreasing plasma 
triangularity which may not be explained by a change in the temperature 
gradient induced by changes in the geometry of the flux surfaces. The plasma 
triangularity is varied over a wide range, from positive to negative values, 
and various plasmas conditions are explored by changing the total electron 
cyclotron (EC) heating power and the plasma density. The mid-radius electron 
heat diffusivity is shown to significantly decrease with decreasing 
triangularity and, for similar plasma conditions, only half of the EC power is 
required at a triangularity of -0.4 compared with +0.4 to obtain the same 
temperature profile. Besides, the observed dependence of the electron heat 
diffusivity on the electron temperature, electron density and effective charge 
can be grouped in a unique dependence on the plasma effective collisionality. 
In summary, the electron heat transport level exhibits a continuous decrease 
with decreasing triangularity and increasing collisionality. Local gyro-fluid 
and global gyro-kinetic simulations predict that trapped electron modes are the 
most unstable modes in these EC heated plasmas with an effective collisionality 
ranging from 0.2 to 1. The modes stability dependence on the plasma 
triangularity is investigated.},

abstract = {Beyond a certain heating power, measured and predicted 
distributions of neutral beam injection (NBI) driven currents deviate from each 
other even in the absence of MHD instabilities. The most reasonable explanation 
is a redistribution of fast NBI ions on a time scale smaller than the current 
redistribution time. The hypothesis of a redistribution of fast ions by 
background turbulence is discussed. Direct numerical simulation of fast test 
particles in a given field of electrostatic turbulence indicates that for 
reasonable parameters fast and thermal particle diffusion can indeed be 
similar. High quality plasma edge density profiles on ASDEX Upgrade and the 
recent extension of the reflectometry system allow for a direct comparison of 
observed TAE eigenfunctions with theoretical ones as obtained with the linear, 
gyrokinetic, global stability code LIGKA. These comparisons support the 
hypothesis of TAE-frequency crossing the continuum at the plasma edge in ASDEX 
Upgrade H-mode discharges. A new fast ion loss detector with 1 MHz time 
resolution allows frequency and phase resolved correlation between the observed 
losses and low frequency magnetic perturbations such as TAE modes and rotating 
magnetic islands. Whereas losses caused by TAE modes are known to be due to 
resonances in velocity space, by modelling the particle drift orbits we were 
able to explain losses caused by magnetic islands as due to island formation 
and stochasticity in the drift orbits.},

excellent agreement is found for a neoclassical equilibrium with parallel ion

self-consistent simulation results of collisionless damping of geodesic

electrons using a full-f code. The electric field is also found to agree with 
the standard neoclassical expression for steep density and ion temperature

endloss of particles and energy induces parallel flow stronger than the core 
neoclassical predictions in the SOL.},

published continuum-code simulations and subsequent global particle-in-cell 
(PIC) simulations of electron-temperature-gradient (ETG) turbulence. Our 
investigations, using gyrokinetic &delta;f-PIC- and continuum-code simulations 
and analytical theory, strongly support the conclusion from the earlier 
continuum-code simulations that ETG turbulence can drive the electron thermal 
conductivity &chi;<sub>e</sub> large enough to be significant in some tokamaks. 
A successful ETG-turbulence benchmark between &delta;f-PIC and continuum codes 
for ETG turbulence has also been completed. Scans in the magnetic shear show an 
abrupt transition to a high-&chi;<sub>e</sub> state as the shear is increased 
from the benchmark value of s = 0.1 to above s = 0.4. When nonadiabatic ions 
are used, this abrupt transition is absent, and &chi;<sub>e</sub> reaches 
values consistent with transport analyses of DIII-D, JET, JT60-U and NSTX 
discharges. The balances of zonal-flow driving and damping terms in late-time 
quasi-steady phase of ITG turbulence have been unfolded using a new run-time 
gyrokinetic-simulation diagnostic. The zonal flow level is set by a balance of 
large driving and damping terms which almost cancel each other. The driving is 
found to be mostly by the Reynolds stress, while the dissipation is mostly by 
the linear (transit-time) damping terms. It is also shown that useful 
zonal-flow-balance information can be obtained with spatially localized samples 
at as few as four poloidal locations. Real-geometry simulations have been 
undertaken, using the nonlinear &delta;f-PIC gyrokinetic code 
SUMMIT/PG3EQ&lowbar;NC, of the DIII-D `Cyclone' shot 81499 and of shot 118561,

Contrary to low-frequency gyrokinetics, which views each particle as a rigid 
charged ring, arbitrary frequency response of a particle is described by a 
quickly changing Kruskal ring. This approach allows the separation of 
gyrocenter and gyrophase responses and thus allows for, in many situations, 
larger time steps for the gyrocenter push than for the gyrophase push. The 
gyrophase response which determines the shape of Kruskal rings can be described 
by a Fourier series in gyrophase for some problems, thus allowing control over 
the cyclotron harmonics at which the plasma responds. A computational algorithm 
for particle-in-cell simulation based on this concept has been developed. An 
example of the ion Bernstein wave is used to illustrate its numerical 
properties, and comparison with a direct Lorentz-force approach is presented.},

have been computed for different values of collisionality. The threshold for 
TEM disappears as the collisionality increases. A detailed study of the 
dependence of the growth rate of the dissipative TEM on collisionality and 
density gradient is presented in the paper. The range of parameters where the 
dissipative trapped electron modes are destabilized by increasing 
collisionality corresponds to very steep density gradients that can hardly be 
achieved in today's large tokamaks.},

simulation suggests that long-wavelength drift wave turbulence in the core is 
marginally stable at the ITB onset, but steepening of the density profile 
destabilizes trapped electron modes (TEMs) inside the barrier The TEM 
ultimately drives sufficient outgoing particle flux to balance the inward pinch

abstract = {Internal transport barriers (ITBs) in the ion channel in the 
tokamak ASDEX Upgrade allow for high energy confinement but collapse after only 
several energy confinement times. In this paper we show that in most cases the 
ITB phase is terminated clearly before the first ELM burst, thereby ruling out 
the ELMs as the main trigger of the ITB collapse. For the first time, the ITB 
formation and sustainment are found to be associated with a mechanism of 
transport suppression based on thermal ions dilution by the injected fast ions. 
Interestingly, such ITBs do not require reversed magnetic shear. The linear 
growth rate of the ion temperature gradient driven mode is computed as a 
function of the fast ion fraction with gyrokinetic stability analysis. Monte 
Carlo simulations predict the fast ion population to be above the gyrokinetic 
critical fraction in a region consistent with the experimental ITB width. The 
density threshold documented for the onset of ASDEX Upgrade ion ITBs is 
explained. The role of T<sub>i</sub>/T<sub>e</sub> and of the plasma sheared 
rotation for ITB sustainment are analysed. The stabilization mechanism 
presented here is consistent with the observed ITB lifetime of the order of the 
beam slowing down time. A possible runaway mechanism leading to ITB collapse is 
described. Finally, the relevance of this particular ITB scheme for ITER is 
discussed},

differential operators and Jacobians are represented numerically which is a 
quite general approach with wide applicability. Discretization of the field 
equations is described. The issue of domain decomposition and particle load 
balancing is addressed. A derivation of the split-weight scheme is given, and 
numerical observations are given as to what algorithmic change leads to stable 
algorithm. It is shown that in the final split-weight algorithm the equation 
for the rate of change of the electric potential is solved in a way that is 
incompatible with the quasi-neutrality condition on the grid scale. This 
incompatibility, while negligible on the scale of interest, leads to better 
numerical stability on the grid scale. Some examples of linear simulations are 
presented to show the effects of flux-surface shaping on the linear mode growth

eigenmodes in burning fusion plasmas requires a detailed understanding of the 
dissipative mechanisms that damp these modes. In order to address this 
question, the linear gyro-kinetic, electromagnetic code LIGKA is employed to 
investigate their behaviour in realistic tokamak geometry. LIGKA is based on an 
eigenvalue formulation and self-consistently calculates the coupling of 
large-scale MHD modes to gyro-radius scale length kinetic Alfven waves. It uses 
the drift-kinetic HAGIS code to accurately describe the unperturbed particle 
orbits in general geometry. In addition, a newly developed antenna-like version 
of LIGKA allows for a frequency scan, analogous to an external antenna. With 
these tools the properties of the kinetically modified TAE in or near the gap 
(KTAE, radiative damping or 'tunnelling') and its coupling to the continuum 
close to the edge are numerically analysed. The results are compared with 
previous calculations based on fluid and other gyro-kinetic models. Also first 
linear calculations on cascade modes are presented},

abstract = {During the pedestal cycle of H-mode edge plasmas in tokamak 
experiments, large-amplitude pedestal build-up and destruction coexist with 
small-amplitude drift wave turbulence. The pedestal dynamics simultaneously 
includes fast time-scale electromagnetic instabilities, long time-scale 
turbulence-induced transport processes, and more interestingly the interaction 
between them. To numerically simulate the pedestal dynamics from first 
principles, it is desirable to develop an effective algorithm based on the 
gyrokinetic theory. However, existing gyrokinetic theories cannot treat fully 
nonlinear electromagnetic perturbations with multi-scale-length structures in 
spacetime, and therefore do not apply to edge plasmas. A set of generalized 
gyrokinetic equations valid for the edge plasmas has been derived. This 
formalism allows large-amplitude, time-dependent background electromagnetic 
fields to be developed fully nonlinearly in addition to small-amplitude, 
short-wavelength electromagnetic perturbations. It turns out that the most 
general gyrokinetic theory can be geometrically formulated. The 
Poincare-Cartan-Einstein 1-form on the 7D phase space determines particles' 
worldlines in the phase space, and realizes the momentum integrals in kinetic 
theory as fiber integrals. The infinitesimal generator of the gyro-symmetry is 
then asymptotically constructed as the base for the gyrophase coordinate of the 
gyrocenter coordinate system. This is accomplished by applying the Lie 
coordinate perturbation method to the Poincare-Cartan-Einstein 1-form. General 
gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are then developed as the Vlasov-Maxwell 
equations in the gyrocenter coordinate system, rather than a set of new 
equations. Because the general gyrokinetic system developed is geometrically 
the same as the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, all the coordinate-independent 
properties of the Vlasov-Maxwell equations, such as energy conservation, 
momentum conservation, and phase space volume conservation, are automatically 
carried over to the general gyrokinetic system. The pullback transformation 
associated with the coordinate transformation is shown to be an indispensable 
part of the general gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations. As an example, the 
pullback transformation in the gyrokinetic Poisson equation is explicitly 
expressed in terms of moments of the gyrocenter distribution function, with the 
important gyro-orbit squeezing effect due to the large electric field shearing 
in the edge and the full finite Larmour radius effect for short wavelength 
fluctuations. The familiar "polarization drift density" in the gyrocenter 
Poisson equation is replaced by a more general expression},

&nabla; &times; b&circ; exceeds a given threshold. Associated with &eta; &gt; 0 
is a parallel electric field E = &eta;j that can accelerate runaway electrons. 
In order to gain observational predictions, we inject electrons inside the 
dissipation regions and follow them for several seconds in real time. 
Precipitating electrons that leave the simulation system at height z = 0 are 
associated with hard X rays, and electrons that escape at height z ~ 3 &times; 
10<sup>4</sup> km are associated with normal-drifting type IIIs at the local 
plasma frequency. A third, trapped population is related to gyrosynchrotron 
emission. Time profiles and spectra of all three emissions are calculated, and 
their dependence on the geometric model parameters and on &eta; is explored. It 
is found that precipitation generally precedes escape by fractions of a second 
and that the electrons perform many visits to the dissipation regions before 
leaving the simulation system. The electrons impacting z = 0 reach higher 
energies than the escaping ones, and non-Maxwellian tails are observed at 
energies above the largest potential drop across a single dissipation region. 
Impact maps at z = 0 show the tendency of the electrons to arrive at the 
borders of sunspots of one polarity. Although the magnetograms used here belong 
to non-flaring times, so that the simulations refer to nanoflares and 
"quiescent" coronal heating, it is conjectured that the same process, on a

abstract = {Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is encountered in a wide 
variety of astrophysical plasmas, including accretion disks, the solar wind, 
and the interstellar and intracluster medium. On small scales, this turbulence 
is often expected to consist of highly anisotropic fluctuations with 
frequencies small compared to the ion cyclotron frequency. For a number of 
applications, the small scales are also collisionless, so a kinetic treatment 
of the turbulence is necessary. We show that this anisotropic turbulence is 
well described by a low-frequency expansion of the kinetic theory called 
gyrokinetics. This paper is the first in a series to examine turbulent 
astrophysical plasmas in the gyrokinetic limit. We derive and explain the 
nonlinear gyrokinetic equations and explore the linear properties of 
gyrokinetics as a prelude to nonlinear simulations. The linear dispersion 
relation for gyrokinetics is obtained, and its solutions are compared to those 
of hot-plasma kinetic theory. These results are used to validate the 
performance of the gyrokinetic simulation code GS2 in the parameter regimes 
relevant for astrophysical plasmas. New results on global energy conservation 
in gyrokinetics are also derived. We briefly outline several of the problems to 
be addressed by future nonlinear simulations, including particle heating by 
turbulence in hot accretion flows and in the solar wind, the magnetic and 
electric field power spectra in the solar wind, and the origin of small-scale 
density fluctuations in the interstellar medium},

plasmas is presented. Using self-consistent gyrokinetic simulations, in concert 
with an analytic asymptotic theory, it is found that alpha particles can 
interact significantly with core ion-temperature-gradient turbulence. 
Specifically, the per-particle flux of energetic alphas is comparable to the 
per-particle flux of thermal species (deuterium or helium ash). This finding 
opposes the conventional wisdom that energetic ions, because of their large 
gyroradii, do not interact with the turbulence. For the parameters studied, a 
turbulent modification of the alpha-particle density profile appears to be 
stronger than turbulent modification of the alpha-particle pressure profile. 
Crude estimates indicate that the alpha density modification, which is directly 
proportional to the core turbulence intensity, could be in the range of 15% at 
midradius in a reactor. The corresponding modification of the alpha-particle 
pressure profile is predicted to be smaller (in the 1% range)},

the energy fluxes from the plasma core. The growth of magnetic islands is 
related to currents flowing parallel to the magnetic field and, for long narrow

from the polarization current can significantly affect the time evolution. A 
numerical solution of the gyro-kinetic equations confirms, and extends, 
previous analytic studies of the effect of the polarization current on the 
island stability. A new analytic approximation that provides a good match over 
the full range of Larmor radius is also presented. The effect of perpendicular 
diffusion on the electron density gradient is simulated by the application of a 
smoothing function, with the results suggesting that the diffusion will 
noticeably affect the contribution of the polarization current to the island

equation to be expressed in conservative form. This facilitates taking moments 
with few approximations, mainly those consistent with drift kinetics for the 
equilibrium distribution function and the relative smallness of the 
fluctuations. The turbulent heating is uniquely defined by choosing the 
standard gyrokinetic definition for the energy flux. With this definition, most 
of the heating can be expressed in the form of ohmic heating from turbulent 
parallel and perpendicular current density perturbations. The latter current is 
identified with grad-B and curvature drifts, plus terms involving magnetic 
perturbations (which are smaller for low beta). A small contribution to the 
heating comes from the divergence of an energy flux that is dependent on the 
finite gyroradius of the ions. The fluxes and heating rates are expressed in a 
form that can be easily evaluated from gyrokinetic turbulence simulations},

turbulent transport on state-of-theart computers has a long history of 
important scientific discoveries. The primary examples are: (i) the 
identification of ion temperature gradient (ITG) drift turbulence as the most 
plausible process responsible for the thermal transport observed in tokamak 
experiments; (ii) the reduction of such transport due to the presence of zonal 
flows; (iii) the confinement scaling trends associated with size of the plasma 
and also with the ionic isotope species. With the availability of terascale 
computers in recent years, we have also been able to carry out simulations with 
improved physics fidelity using experimentally relevant parameters. 
Computationally, we have demonstrated that our lead Particle-in- Cell (PIC) 
code, the Gyrokinetic Turbulence Code (GTC), is portable, efficient, and 
scalable on various MPP platforms. Convergence studies with unprecedented 
phase-space resolution have also been carried out. Since petascale resources 
are expected to be available in the near future, we have also engaged in 
developing better physics models and more efficient numerical algorithms to 
take advantage of this exciting opportunity. For the near term, we are 
interested in understanding some basic physics issues related to burning 
plasmas experiments in International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) 
- a multi-billion dollar device to be constructed over the next decade. Our 
long range goal is to carry out integrated simulations for ITER plasmas for a

abstract = {This paper describes the behavior of nickel in low confinement 
(L-mode) and high confinement (H-mode) Joint European Torus (JET) discharges 
[P. J. Lomas, Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion 31, 1481 (1989)] characterized by 
the application of radio-frequency (rf) power heating and featuring ITER 
(International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) relevant collisionality. The 
impurity transport is analyzed on the basis of perturbative experiments (laser 
blow off injection) and is compared with electron heat and deuterium transport. 
In the JET plasmas analyzed here, ion cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH) is 
applied either in mode conversion (MC) to heat the electrons or in minority 
heating (MH) to heat the ions. The two heating schemes have systematically 
different effects on nickel transport, yielding flat or slightly hollow nickel 
density profiles in the case of ICRH in MC and peaked nickel density profiles 
in the case of rf applied in MH. Accordingly, both diffusion coefficients and 
pinch velocities of nickel are found to be systematically different. Linear 
gyrokinetic calculations by means of the code GS2 [M. Kotschenreuther, G. 
Rewoldt, and W.M. Tang, Comput. Phys. Commun. 88, 128 (1995)] provide a 
possible explanation of such different behavior by exploring the effects 
produced by the different microinstabilities present in these plasmas. In 
particular, trapped electron modes driven by the stronger electron temperature 
gradients measured in the MC cases, although subdominant, produce a 
contribution to the impurity pinch directed outwards that is qualitatively in 
agreement with the pinch reversal found in the experiment. Particle and heat 
diffusivities appear to be decoupled in MH shots, with &chi;<sub>e</sub> and 
D<sub>D</sub>&Gt;D<sub>Ni</sub>, and are instead quite similar in the MC ones. 
In the latter case, nickel transport appears to be driven by the same 
turbulence that drives the electron heat transport and is sensitive to the 
value of the electron temperature gradient length. These findings give ground 
to the idea that in ITER it should be possible to find conditions in which the 
risk of accumulation of metals such as nickel can be contained},

for adiabatic electrons. Linear and nonlinear simulation results from the two 
different forms of the gyrokinetic Poisson equation (integral form and the

modes, zonal flows and geodesic acoustic modes (GAM) in tokamak plasmas are 
investigated using a global nonlinear gyrokinetic formulation with totally 
unconstrained evolution of temperature gradient and profile. A series of 
numerical simulations with the same initial temperature and density profile 
specifications is performed using a sequence of ideal MHD equilibria differing 
only in the value of the total plasma current, in particular with identical 
magnetic shear profiles and shapes of magnetic surfaces. On top of a bursty or 
quasi-steady state behaviour the zonal flows oscillate at the GAM frequency. 
The amplitude of these oscillations increases with the value of the safety 
factor q, resulting in a less effective suppression of ITG turbulence by zonal 
flows at a lower plasma current. The turbulence-driven volume-averaged radial 
heat transport is found to scale inversely with the total plasma current},

(there is zero velocity-space dissipation in GYRO) and the reduction of entropy 
via the production of fluctuations are monitored in detail. This new diagnostic 
has yielded several key confirmations of the validity of the GYRO simulations. 
First, fluctuations balance dissipation in the ensemble-averaged sense, thus 
demonstrating that turbulent GYRO simulations achieve a true statistical steady 
state. Second, at the standard spatial grid size, neither entropy nor energy 
flux is significantly changed by a 16-fold increase (from 32 to 512 grid points 
per cell) in the number of grid points in the two-dimensional velocity space. 
Third, the measured flux is invariant to an eightfold increase in the upwind 
dissipation coefficients. A notable conclusion is that the lack of change in 
entropy with grid refinement refutes the familiar but incorrect notion that 
Eulerian gyrokinetic codes miss important velocity-space structure. The issues 
of density and energy conservation and their relation to negligible 
second-order effects such as the parallel nonlinearity are also discussed},

abstract = {This paper reports on over 100 nonlinear simulations used to 
systematically study the effects of safety factor q and magnetic shear s&circ; 
on turbulent energy and particle transport due to ion temperature gradient 
(ITG) modes and trapped electron modes (TEM) for several reference cases using 
the GYRO gyrokinetic code. All the simulations are collisionless, 
electrostatic, and utilize shifted circle geometry. The motivation is to create 
a database for benchmarking and testing of turbulent transport models. In 
simulations varying q, it is found that the ion and electron energy transport 
exhibit an offset linear dependence on q for 1&les;q&les;4. This result is 
valid for cases in which the spectrum is dominated by either TEM or ITG modes. 
The particle transport also follows a linear q dependence if the diffusivity D 
is positive (outward). If a particle pinch is predicted, however, then D is 
found to be insensitive to q. In kinetic electron simulations varying the 
magnetic shear s&circ;, the particle transport can exhibit a null flow at a 
particular value of s&circ;. In the vicinity of the null flow point, the 
transport spectrum shows that some modes drive an inward flow while others 
drive an outward flow. For negative magnetic shear, the magnetohydrodynamic 
&alpha; parameter is shown to be stabilizing for both the energy and particle 
transport but can be destabilizing for large positive shear. Compared to the 
ITG dominated case, the TEM cases show the same linear q dependence, but a 
weaker s&circ; dependence is exhibited for positive magnetic shear values when 
TEM modes dominate the spectrum. In general, the q, s&circ;, and &alpha; 
dependence of the transport including kinetic electrons is consistent with ITG 
adiabatic electron simulation results},

the Gyro-Landau fluid transport model GLF23 (Waltz et al. 1997 Phys. Plasmas 4 
2482). In this work we have compared two different MHD equilibria for a TCV 
discharge with an eITB, corresponding to a monotonic and a reversed safety 
factor profile. The latter has been obtained using the calculated 
electron-cyclotron driven density profile, the bootstrap current and the 
experimental pressure. Global simulations show that the most unstable 
electrostatic instabilities in the spectrum are trapped electron modes (TEM) 
for both equilibria. In the vicinity of the reverse shear region, where the 
magnetic shear s is positive and small (s &Lt; 1), modes tend to preserve the 
ballooning structure but their mixing length estimate for the thermal diffusion 
coefficient is significantly reduced as compared with the monotonic q 
equilibrium. This effect is further increased in the reverse shear region. 
Simulations performed with GLF23 show that the inclusion of the Shafranov shift 
in the model has an important stabilizing effect in all the plasma core and, in 
particular, in the barrier region. However, the Shafranov shift and reverse 
shear stabilization are not the only mechanisms through which the q profile 
affects the stability of the system. The local value of q in the barrier region 
also contributes to the stabilization. Global gyrokinetic and local Gyro-Landau 
fluid results suggest that the current profile modification alone, with the 
consequent negative shear and Shafranov shift stabilization on TEM modes, can 
explain the presence of the ITB in these TCV discharges},

abstract = {With the term microinstabilities, we indicate a class of plasma 
drift waves such as the ion temperature gradient (ITG) mode, the trapped 
electron mode (TEM) and the electromagnetic Alfvenic ion temperature gradient 
(AITG) mode. They are usually driven by spatial gradients in the plasma and 
they are held responsible for anomalous transport and enhanced heat flux in 
tokamaks. Their understanding is therefore crucial for the development of 
magnetically confined plasma fusion devices. Our approach is based on the 
gyrokinetic model (Hahm 1988) for particle dynamics. The gyrokinetic nonlinear 
Vlasov equation, in the presence of an electromagnetic perturbation (Brizard 
1989, 1995), is derived using Lie perturbation theory (Cary and Littlejohn 
1983) to average out the fast particle motion around the gyrocenter. We have 
linearized the gyrokinetic Vlasov equation and added the quasi-neutrality 
equation and Ampere's law, providing closure to the system. A temporal spectral 
formulation is used, ensuring the absence of numerical instabilities due to 
high frequency modes. The equations are simplified with a large aspect ratio 
approximation for an axisymmetric toroidal configuration. The fields are 
expanded in a Fourier series in the three spatial directions (radial, poloidal, 
and toroidal) reducing the problem in a matrix form. The code EM-GLOGYSTO 
(Brunner et al. 1998; Falchetto et al. 2003; Joint Varenna-Lausanne 
International Work 2002) has been developed to look at its solutions. Recently, 
we have included in the model an electrostatic equilibrium potential in order 
to provide E&times;B sheared flow. The code has been optimized for running in a 
parallel environment using MPI routines, and it allows us to study frequencies, 
growth rates, and mode structures of electromagnetic microinstabilities. 
Results on an AITG mode are shown to illustrate these features},

abstract = {Velocity-space structures of ion distribution function associated 
with the ion temperature gradient (ITG) turbulence and the collisionless 
damping of the zonal flow are investigated by means of a newly developed 
toroidal gyrokinetic-Vlasov simulation code with high velocity-space 
resolution. The present simulation on the zonal flow and the geodesic acoustic 
mode (GAM) successfully reproduces the neoclassical polarization of trapped 
ions as well as the parallel phase mixing due to passing particles. During the 
collisionless damping of GAM, finer-scale structures of the ion distribution 
function in the velocity space continue to develop due to the phase mixing 
while preserving an invariant defined by a sum of an entropy variable and the 
potential energy. Simulation results of the toroidal ITG turbulent transport 
clearly show generation of the fine velocity-space structures of the 
distribution function and their collisional dissipation. Detailed calculation 
of the entropy balance confirms the statistically steady state of turbulence, 
where the anomalous transport balances with the dissipation given by the weak 
collisionality. The above results obtained by simulations with high 
velocity-space resolution are also understood in terms of generation, transfer, 
and dissipation processes of the entropy variable in the phase space},

al., Proceedings of the 20th Fusion Energy Conference, Vilamoura, Portugal, 
2004 (IAEA, Vienna, 2005)] yielded different results from earlier flux-tube 
continuum code simulations [F. Jenko and W. Dorland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 
225001 (2002)] despite similar plasma parameters. Differences between the 
simulation results were attributed to insufficient phase-space resolution and 
novel physics associated with global simulation models. The results of the 
global PIC code are reproduced here using the flux-tube PIC code PG3EQ [A. M. 
Dimits et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 77, 71 (1996)], thereby eliminating global 
effects as the cause of the discrepancy. The late-time decay of the ETG 
turbulence and the steady-state heat transport observed in these PIC 
simulations are shown to result from discrete particle noise. Discrete particle 
noise is a numerical artifact, so both these PG3EQ simulations and, by 
inference, the GTC simulations that they reproduced have little to say about 
steady-state ETG turbulence and the associated anomalous heat transport. In the 
course of this work several diagnostics are developed to retrospectively test 
whether a particular PIC simulation is dominated by discrete particle noise},

the "reduced kinetic model." An antenna-like version of LIGKA allows one to 
systematically find all shear-Alfven-type modes in a given frequency interval,

kinetic Alfven wave (KAW) is found in the form of continuum damping and 
radiative damping. For the cases examined here, no mode conversion in the

be an invaluable tool to study key effects of low-frequency microturbulence in 
fusion plasmas. As a high-performance computing applications code, its flexible 
mixed-model parallel algorithm has allowed GTC to scale to over a thousand 
processors, which is routinely used for simulations. Improvements are 
continuously being made. As the U.S. ramps up its support for the International 
Tokamak Experimental Reactor (ITER), the need for understanding the impact of 
turbulent transport in burning plasma fusion devices is of utmost importance.

abstract = {Research on the Alcator C-Mod tokamak has emphasized RF heating, 
self-generated flows, momentum transport, scrape-off layer (SOL) turbulence and 
transport and the physics of transport barrier transitions, stability and 
control. The machine operates with P<sub>RF</sub> up to 6 MW corresponding to 
power densities on the antenna of 10 MW m<sup>-2</sup>. Analysis of rotation 
profile evolution, produced in the absence of external drive, allows transport 
of angular momentum in the plasma core to be computed and compared between 
various operating regimes. Momentum is clearly seen diffusing and convecting 
from the plasma edge on time scales similar to the energy confinement time and 
much faster than neo-classical transport. SOL turbulence and transport have 
been studied with fast scanning electrostatic probes situated at several 
poloidal locations and with gas puff imaging. Strong poloidal asymmetries are 
found in profiles and fluctuations, confirming the essential ballooning 
character of the turbulence and transport. Plasma topology has a dominant 
effect on the magnitude and direction of both core rotation and SOL flows. The 
correlation of self-generated plasma flows and topology has led to a novel 
explanation for the dependence of the H-mode power threshold on the &nabla;B 
drift direction. Research into internal transport barriers has focused on 
control of the barrier strength and location. The foot of the barrier could be 
moved to larger minor radius by lowering q or B<sub>T</sub>. The barriers, 
which are produced in C-Mod by off-axis RF heating, can be weakened by the 
application of on-axis power. Gyro-kinetic simulations suggest that the control 
mechanism is due to the temperature dependence of trapped electron modes which 
are destabilized by the large density gradients. A set of non-axisymmetric 
coils was installed allowing intrinsic error fields to be measured and 
compensated. These also enabled the determination of the mode locking threshold 
and, by comparison with data from other machines, provided the first direct 
measurement of size scaling for the threshold. The installation of a new 
inboard limiter resulted in the reduction of halo currents following 
disruptions. This effect can be understood in terms of the change in plasma 
contact with the altered geometry during vertical displacement of the plasma 
column. Unstable Alfven eigenmodes (AE) were observed in low-density, 
high-power ICRF heated plasmas. The damping rate of stable AEs was investigated 
with a pair of active MHD antennae},

zonal modes. Conversely, when streamers dominate, the equilibrium profiles are 
found to be stiff. In the non-linear regime and steady-state turbulence, the

distribution. This property is characterized by an expansion on generalized 
Laguerre functions with a slow decay of the series of moments. This justifies 
the use of gyrokinetic simulations since a standard fluid approach, based on a 
limited number of moments, would certainly require a complex closure so as to 
take into account the impact of these non-vanishing high order moments},

of the electron inertia on the MHD phenomena in the reversed shear

collisionless (kinetic) double tearing modes grow at the Alfven time scale and 
nonlinearly induce the internal collapse when the helical flux at the magnetic 
axis is less than that at the outer resonant surface. After the internal 
collapse, the secondary reconnection is induced by the current concentration 
due to the m = 2 convective flow. It is also clarified that a nonlinear 
dynamics accompanying the elementary processes caused by the m = 2 flow can 
generate a new reversed shear configuration with resonant surfaces. In the 
presence of the density gradient, after the full reconnection induced by the m

difference of the E &times; B motion between ions and electrons. However, the 
intensity of the radial field is not as large as that induced by the 
collisionless kink mode},

transport in stable regions. A heuristic theory of this nonlocal transport

abstract = {Predictive transport modelling and gyrokinetic stability analyses 
of demonstration hybrid (HYBRID) and advanced tokamak (AT) discharges from the 
International Tokamak Physics Activity (ITPA) profile database are presented. 
Both regimes have exhibited enhanced core confinement (above the conventional 
ITER reference H-mode scenario) but differ in their current density profiles. 
Recent contributions to the ITPA database have facilitated an effort to study 
the underlying physics governing confinement in these advanced scenarios. In 
this paper, we assess the level of commonality of the turbulent transport 
physics and the relative roles of the transport suppression mechanisms (i.e. E 
&times; B shear and Shafranov shift (&alpha;) stabilization) using data for 
select HYBRID and AT discharges from the DIII-D, JET and AUG tokamaks. GLF23 
transport modelling and gyrokinetic stability analysis indicate that E &times; 
B shear and Shafranov shift stabilization play essential roles in producing the 
improved core confinement in both HYBRID and AT discharges. Shafranov shift 
stabilization is found to be more important in AT discharges than in HYBRID 
discharges. We have also examined the competition between the stabilizing 
effects of E &times; B shear and Shafranov shift stabilization and the 
destabilizing effects of higher safety factors and parallel velocity shear. 
Linear and nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of idealized low and high safety 
factor cases reveal some interesting consequences. A low safety factor (i.e. 
HYBRID relevant) is directly beneficial in reducing the transport, and E 
&times; B shear stabilization can dominate parallel velocity shear 
destabilization allowing the turbulence to be quenched. However, at low-q/high 
current, Shafranov shift stabilization plays less of a role. Higher safety 
factors (as found in AT discharges), on the other hand, have larger amounts of 
Shafranov shift stabilization, but parallel velocity shear destabilization can 
prevent E &times; B shear quenching of the turbulent transport, and only E 
&times; B suppression is achieved},

The impact of E&times;B shear stabilization in electrostatic flux-tube 
simulations is well modeled by a simple quench rule with the turbulent 
diffusivity scaling like 
1-&alpha;<sub>E</sub>&gamma;<sub>E</sub>/&gamma;<sub>max</sub>, where 
&gamma;<sub>E</sub> is the E&times;B shear rate, &gamma;<sub>max</sub> is 
maximum linear growth rate without E&times;B shear, and &alpha;<sub>E</sub> is 
a multiplier. The quench rule was originally deduced from adiabatic electron 
ion temperature gradient (ITG) simulations where it was found that 
&alpha;<sub>E</sub>&ap;1. The results presented in this paper show that the 
quench rule also applies in the presence of kinetic electrons for 
long-wavelength transport down to the ion gyroradius scale. Without parallel 
velocity shear, the electron and ion transport is quenched near 
&gamma;<sub>E</sub>/&gamma;<sub>max</sub>&ap;2 (&alpha;<sub>E</sub>&ap;1/2). 
When the destabilizing effect of parallel velocity shear is included in the 
simulations, consistent with purely toroidal rotation, the transport may not be 
completely quenched by any level of E&times;B shear because the 
Kelvin-Helmholtz drive increases &gamma;<sub>max</sub> faster than

Three linear modes of potential importance are found: the Kelvin-Helmholtz 
instability, the tertiary mode, and a nonlocal drift wave instability. Each 
mode is unstable only in the presence of nontrivial spatial variations in 
either the E&times;B flow and/or the plasma gradients. The strongest conclusion 
of this study is that the drift wave mode may be an important driver of 
anomalous transport in the edge region of magnetic confinement devices. Two 
other weaker conclusions that warrant further study are as follows: (1) the 
Kelvin-Helmholtz instability may be associated with edge-localized modes or 
edge transport and (2) the tertiary mode can potentially limit the radial 
growth of a transport barrier},

abstract = {A strong ITB was sustained in a reversed shear discharge in JET 
during a long time interval after a significant reduction in plasma heating 
power. The observed ITB evolution is reminiscent of the effect of hysteresis, 
associated in theory with turbulence suppression due to shear of the plasma 
rotation. The mechanism of ITB sustainment was analysed. Modelling of the 
plasma heating and current profile was done using the TRANSP and JETTO 
transport codes. The resulting q-profile evolution was verified by comparison 
with the pitch angle &delta; = B<sub>p</sub>/B<sub>t</sub> deduced from 
motional Stark effect measurements (where B<sub>p</sub> and B<sub>t</sub> are 
the poloidal and toroidal magnetic field, respectively). Turbulence stability 
was analysed using the gyro-kinetic code Kinezero. It was shown that the strong 
negative magnetic shear produced by LHCD and sustained mainly by the bootstrap 
current in the plasma core is responsible for the turbulence stabilization. 
Stabilization due to shear of the plasma rotation and finite &beta; 
-stabilization play a complimentary role. The effect of bootstrap and LH driven 
currents on magnetic shear in JET discharges was analysed},

saturation levels are determined using nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations. Using

abstract = {A novel new kinetic simulation model has been developed to 
investigate dynamics in collisionless plasmas. In this model, the electrons are 
treated as gyrokinetic (GK) particles and ions are treated as fully kinetic 
(FK) particles. In the GK-electron and FK-ion (GKe/FKi) plasma simulation 
model, the rapid electron cyclotron motion is removed, while keeping finite 
electron Larmor radii, realistic electron-to-ion mass ratio, wave-particle 
interactions, and off-diagonal components of the electron pressure tensor. The 
model is particularly suitable for plasma dynamics with wave frequencies lower 
than the electron gyrofrequency, and for problems in which the wave modes 
ranging from Alfv&eacute;n waves to lower-hybrid/whistler waves need to be 
handled on an equal footing. Using this model, the computation power can be 
significantly improved over that of the existing full-particle codes. The 
GKe/FKi model, furthermore, can also handle physics with realistic 
electron-to-ion mass ratio and dynamic processes on the global Alfv&eacute;n 
time/spatial scales. With respect to the hybrid (i.e. FK ion and fluid 
electron) model, the GKe/FKi model has the advantage that important electron

abstract = {A linear, one-dimensional gyrofluid code including electron 
inertia, electron pressure gradient, and finite ion gyroradius effects is 
applied to an inhomogeneous dayside auroral field line to determine the 
characteristics of propagating Alfven waves with small perpendicular 
wavelengths. Test particles are then used to study the behavior of both 
magnetosheath (100 eV) and background ionospheric electrons (2 eV) under the 
influence of dispersive Alfven waves. Although the test particle approach is 
not self-consistent, the gyrofluid/test particle simulation is able to 
reproduce many of the features observed by low-altitude satellites. The test 
particle simulations verify results from previous studies, such as reproducing 
electron energy and pitch-angle dispersions, and in doing so, validate the 
approach. The test particle simulations also show how resonant particles can 
lead to low-energy field-aligned electron bursts that are commonly observed in 
the dayside auroral region. The new results in this study reveal the plasma 
conditions necessary for electron resonance. We show that an increased mass 
density (significant O<sup>+</sup> density) in the acceleration region is an 
essential prerequisite to generate an electron burst. The primary effect of the 
O<sup>+</sup> is to decrease the phase speed of the Alfven wave. Furthermore, 
the full gyrokinetic effects of the O<sup>+</sup> act to produce a region in 
which the Alfven speed profile is gradually slowing, which allows electrons 
remaining within the wave to lower altitudes. In these electron bursts, the 
energy gain experienced by the majority of electrons ranges from tens to 
hundreds of eV. The trapping occurs if the parallel electric field is 
substantial enough (~0.2 mV/m) in the acceleration region to accelerate the 
background electrons. An integrated energy flux of accelerated electrons is 
estimated to be 3 erg s<sup>-1</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup>, about 20% of the Alfven 
wave Poynting flux},

B<sub>&par;</sub> fluctuations are too weak to play any crucial role. (ii) In 
the later case, inclusion of Shafranov shift leads to the following: (a) Growth 
rates without Shafranov shift effects are in general larger than those 
including Shafranov shift; (b) nonmonotonous dependence of growth rates and 
frequencies on

abstract = {Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations of trapped electron mode (TEM) 
turbulence, within an internal particle transport barrier, are performed and 
compared with experimental data. The results provide a mechanism for transport 
barrier control with on-axis radio frequency heating, as demonstrated in 
Alcator C-Mod experiments [S. J. Wukitch et al., Phys. Plasmas 9, 2149 (2002)]. 
Off-axis heating produces an internal particle and energy transport barrier 
after the transition to enhanced D&alpha; high confinement mode. The barrier 
foot reaches the half-radius, with a peak density 2.5 times the edge density. 
While the density profile peaks, the temperature profile remains relatively 
unaffected. The peaking and concomitant impurity accumulation are controlled by 
applying modest central heating power late in the discharge. Gyrokinetic 
turbulence simulations of the barrier formation phase, using the GS2 code [W. 
Dorland et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5579 (2000)] show that toroidal ion 
temperature gradient driven modes are suppressed inside the barrier foot, but 
continue to dominate in the outer half-radius. As the density gradient steepens 
further, trapped electron modes are driven unstable. The onset of TEM 
turbulence produces an outflow that strongly increases with the density 
gradient, upon exceeding a new nonlinear critical density gradient, which 
significantly exceeds the linear critical density gradient. The TEM turbulent 
outflow ultimately balances the inward Ware pinch, leading to steady state. 
Moreover, the simulated turbulent particle diffusivity matches that inferred 
from particle balance using measured density profile data and the calculated 
Ware pinch. This turbulent diffusivity exhibits a strong unfavorable 
temperature dependence that allows control with central heating},

conservation property is satisfied with an unprecedented quality well into the

temperature gradient turbulence is that the fluctuations are microscopic, while 
the resulting turbulent transport is not gyro-Bohm [Z. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. 
Lett. 88, 195004 (2002)]. A possible resolution to this puzzle is identified as 
turbulence spreading from the linearly active (unstable) region to the linearly 
inactive (stable) region. Large scale gyrokinetic simulations found that 
transport driven by microscopic fluctuations is diffusive and local, whereas 
the fluctuation intensity is determined by nonlocal effects. Fluctuations are 
found to spread from the linearly active region to the linearly inactive 
region. This turbulence spreading reduces the fluctuation intensity in the 
unstable region, especially for a smaller device size, and thus introduces a 
nonlocal dependence in the fluctuation intensity. The device size dependence of 
the fluctuation intensity, in turn, is responsible for the observed gradual 
transition from Bohm to gyro-Bohm transport scaling},

the sheared flow thus reducing the radial extent and the growth rate of modes.

&delta;f PIC simulation code is developed to study the detailed mechanisms of 
energetic particle drift-bounce resonant destabilization of Alfven modes in the 
ring-current region of the magnetosphere. The code is based on a reduced 
initial-value formulation of eigenmode equations which were solved 
perturbatively in a previous paper. The model plasma is composed of a cold (~ 
100eV) component which provides inertia plus a tenuous energetic (~ 10keV) 
"ring-current" component which provides drift-bounce resonant destabilization 
of odd and even parity modes and gyrokinetic compressional stabilization of the 
fundamental even modes. Full kinetic effects such as finite Larmor radii and 
particle magnetic bounce and precessional drift motions are retained 
nonperturbatively. A simple finite &beta; dipolar equilibrium model is assumed. 
Simulations show excellent agreement with earlier perturbative analyses. 
Results show that, when the energetic ion thermal velocity is super-Alfvenic, 
the ions destabilize shear Alfven MHD modes via the drift-bounce resonances. 
The growth rates of the resulting modes scale linearly with plasma &beta;. The 
most unstable of these modes are found to be drift-bounce resonance 
destabilized modes with odd parity, with wavenumbers such that the equatorial 
thermal value of k<sub>&perp;</sub>&rho;&ap;0.5. The destabilization first

growth of internal kink. It has a strong stabilizing effect nonlinearly and 
causes mode saturation if its profile is maintained, e.g. through a fast 
momentum source. Normally, however, the flow profile itself flattens during the 
reconnection process, allowing a complete reconnection to occur. In some cases, 
the maximum density and pressure spontaneously occur inside the island and 
cause mode saturation. Gyrokinetic hot particle/MHD hybrid studies of NSTX show 
the effects of fluid compression on a fast-ion driven n = 1 mode. MHD studies

abstract = {The pivotal role played by radial electric fields in the 
development of turbulence associated with anomalous transport is examined by 
means of global gyrokinetic simulations. It is shown that the stabilizing 
effect of E &times; B flows on ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes is 
quadratic in the shearing rate amplitude. For a given shearing rate it leads to 
an increase in the critical gradient. The electric fields (zonal flows) 
self-generated by ITG modes interact in a nonlinear way and it is shown that a 
saturated level of both the zonal flow and ITG turbulence is reached in the 
absence of any collisional mechanism being included in the model. The quality 
of the global nonlinear simulations is verified by the energy conservation 
which is allowed by the inclusion of nonlinear parallel dynamics. This 
demonstrates the absence of spurious damping of numerical origin and thus 
confirms the nonlinear character of zonal flow saturation mechanism},

visualization of plasma turbulence is presently under development for the 
TEXTOR-94 tokamak. This system combines a high resolution electron cyclotron 
emission imaging (ECEI) diagnostic with an innovative microwave imaging 
reflectometer (MIR) diagnostic for the simultaneous localized measurement of 
electron temperature T. and electron density n<sub>e</sub> fluctuations in the 
tokamak core. The ECEI diagnostic images second harmonic cyclotron radiation 
from the optically thick plasma onto a 1-D array, thereby forming an image of 
the T<sub>e</sub> profile and fluctuations associated with the emission layer. 
The MIR diagnostic images radiation reflected from the plasma cutoff layer onto 
a similar 1-D array, thus forming an image of n<sub>e</sub> fluctuations at the 
reflecting layer. Both diagnostics are capable of forming 2-D images of plasma 
turbulence by varying the frequency of the probing (for MIR) or received (for 
ECEI) signals. Adjustment of the reflectometer probing frequency permits the 
reflecting layer to be positioned coincident with the ECEI emission layer, 
thereby simultaneously sampling both T<sub>e</sub> and n<sub>e</sub> 
fluctuations over an extended surface of the TEXTOR-94 plasma. Such data will 
permit the visualization of complicated 2-D and/or 3-D structures which is 
essential for definitive comparisons to be made with the predictions of 
gyrokinetic computer simulations. In addition, the system will also be employed 
in the study of a number of MM phenomena such as plasma filament formation, 
magnetic islands and internal transport barriers. An overview of the 
simultaneous imaging diagnostic concept will be presented along with technical 
details and characterization measurements of the TEXTOR-94 diagnostic. The

abstract = {Generalized Kelvin-Helmholtz (GKH) instability is examined as a 
mechanism for the saturation of zonal flows in the collisionless regime. By 
focusing on strong turbulence regimes, GKH instability is analyzed in the 
presence of a background of finite-amplitude drift waves. A detailed study of a 
simple model with cold ions shows that nonlinear excitation of GKH modes via 
modulational instability can be comparable to their linear generation. 
Furthermore, it is demonstrated that zonal flows are likely to grow faster than 
GKH mode near marginality, with insignificant turbulent viscous damping by 
linear GKH. The effect of finite ion temperature fluctuations is incorporated 
in a simple toroidal ion temperature gradient model, within which both zonal 
flow and temperature are generated by modulational instability. The phase 
between the two is calculated self-consistently and shown to be positive. 
Furthermore, the correction to nonlinear generation of GKH modes appears to be 
small, being of order O(&rho;<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup>). Thus, the 
role of linear GKH instability in the saturation of collisionless zonal flows, 
in general, seems dubious},

abstract = {Results of stability analysis are presented for two types of plasma 
with good confinement: internal transport barriers (ITBs) on Tore Supra and the 
radiative improved (RI) mode on TEXTOR. The stability analysis has been 
performed with an electrostatic linear gyrokinetic code, evaluating the growth 
rates of microinstabilities. The code developed, KINEZERO, is aimed at 
systematic microstability analysis. Therefore the trade-off between having 
perfect quantitative agreement and minimizing computation time is made in 
favour of the latter. In the plasmas analysed, it is found that the onset of 
the confinement improvement involves a trigger. For the ITB discharges, 
negative magnetic shear is involved, whereas for the RI discharges, the 
triggering role is played by the increase of the impurity concentration. Once

ion temperature gradient (ITG) modes and trapped particle modes are 
investigated with a full radius gyrokinetic formulation in both axisymmetric 
and helically symmetric configurations. The validity of a simplified 
stabilization criterion often applied to experimental analysis (the shearing 
rate larger than the linear growth rate) is examined for various profiles of 
E&times;B flows using an expression for the shearing rate derived for arbitrary 
quasisymmetric geometries [T. S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas <b>4</b>, 4074 (1997)]. 
The results show that the criterion holds for profiles with finite shearing 
rate and for toroidal, helical, and slab-like ITG modes. However, it is not 
always applicable for trapped particle instabilities: a case is shown for which 
E&times;B flows are destabilizing. For profiles with zero shearing rate, 
another stabilizing mechanism is found for toroidal and helical ITG modes but 
not for slab-like modes},

The higher order interpolation schemes are chosen because of their optimal 
performance, balancing a smaller number of particles against more computer 
operations per particle per time step. However, this is not the case in 
large-scale gyrokinetic particle simulations, where sometimes 
nearest-grid-point interpolation is used with results virtually identical to 
those of linear interpolation using the same number of particles. Here, a 
comparison and analysis of nearest-grid-point and linear interpolation schemes 
is given showing why nearest-grid-point interpolation can be optimal. A simple 
two-dimensional slab model of the ion-temperature-gradient instability and 
associated generation of zonal flows is used to compare the interpolation 
schemes. Significant improvements in performance are possible by using 
nearest-grid-point interpolation because of the large number of 
gathers/scatters associated with gyroaveraging},

fluid equations are derived from moments of the drift kinetic equation, taking 
the small mass ratio limit, but with finite electron temperature. This model 
eliminates the inertial Alfv&eacute;n wave and any physics relating to electron 
transit motion, making it useful for studying low frequency, high &beta; 
(&beta;&Gt;m<sub>e</sub>/m<sub>i</sub>) electromagnetic turbulence as well as 
kinetic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) physics including kinetic ballooning and 
toroidal Alfv&eacute;n eigenmodes. Electromagnetic effects 
(&delta;<b>B</b><sub>&perp;</sub>) are included through the parallel ion and 
electron current. A predictor-corrector scheme for the fluid part that is 
consistent with the gyrokinetic ion part has been developed. Here we derive the 
model equations, derive the linear kinetic-fluid theory in a three-dimensional 
shearless slab, and compare the simulation results with the linear theory},

an important factor in obtaining high energy confinement. Without density 
profile peaking, the energy confinement at high density degraded with reduction 
in the H-mode pedestal pressure under the stiff temperature profile conditions 
observed at high density on DIII-D. Reduction in the pedestal pressure was 
associated with loss of access to the second stable regime for ideal ballooning 
modes at the edge, and change in the edge-localized mode (ELM) instability from 
a low to high toroidal mode number. Gyrokinetic stability calculations indicate 
that the core of the high-density discharges is dominated by ion temperature 
gradient mode turbulence. A turbulent transport simulation with the GLF23 
[Waltz et al., Phys. Plasmas <b>4</b>, 2482 (1997)] code produced stiff 
temperature profiles in agreement with the experiment and did not indicate the

anomalous inward particle pinch at high density. The highest density discharges 
were terminated by onset of a magnetohydromagnetic instability, which is 
consistent with destabilization of neoclassical tearing modes through peaking

abstract = {One of the central physics issues currently targeted by nonlinear 
gyrokinetic simulations is the role of finite-&beta; effects. The latter change 
the MHD equilibrium, introduce new dynamical space and time scales, alter and 
enlarge the zoo of electrostatic microinstabilities and saturation mechanisms, 
and lead to turbulent transport along fluctuating magnetic field lines. It is 
shown that the electromagnetic effects on primarily electrostatic 
microinstabilities are generally weakly or moderately stabilizing. However, the 
saturation of these modes and I hence the determination of the transport level 
in the quasi-stationary turbulent state can be dominated by nonlinear 
electromagnetic effects and yield surprising results. Despite this, the induced 
transport is generally electrostatic in nature well below the ideal ballooning 
limit},

abstract = {Gyrocenter-gauge kinetic theory is developed as an extension of the 
existing gyrokinetic theories. In essence, the formalism introduced here is a 
kinetic description of magnetized plasmas in the gyrocenter coordinates which 
is fully equivalent to the Vlasov-Maxwell system in the particle coordinates. 
In particular, provided the gyroradius is smaller than the scale-length of the 
magnetic field, it can treat high-frequency range as well as the usual 
low-frequency range normally associated with gyrokinetic approaches. A 
significant advantage of this formalism is that it enables the direct 
particle-in-cell simulations of compressional Alfv&eacute;n waves for 
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) applications and of rf (radio frequency) waves 
relevant to plasma heating in space and laboratory plasmas. The 
gyrocenter-gauge kinetic susceptibility for arbitrary wavelength and arbitrary 
frequency electromagnetic perturbations in a homogeneous magnetized plasma is 
shown to recover exactly the classical result obtained by integrating the 
Vlasov-Maxwell system in the particle coordinates. This demonstrates that all 
the waves supported by the Vlasov-Maxwell system can be studied using the 
gyrocenter-gauge kinetic model in the gyrocenter coordinates. This theoretical 
approach is so named to distinguish it from the existing gyrokinetic theory, 
which has been successfully developed and applied to many important 
low-frequency and long parallel wavelength problems, where the conventional 
meaning of &ldquo;gyrokinetic&rdquo; has been standardized. Besides the usual 
gyrokinetic distribution function, the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic theory 
emphasizes as well the gyrocenter-gauge distribution function, which sometimes 
contains all the physics of the problems being studied, and whose importance 
has not been realized previously. The gyrocenter-gauge distribution function 
enters Maxwell's equations through the pull-back transformation of the 
gyrocenter transformation, which depends on the perturbed fields. The efficacy 
of the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic approach is largely due to the fact that it 
directly decouples particle's gyromotion from its gyrocenter motion in the 
gyrocenter coordinates. As in the case of kinetic theories using guiding center 
coordinates, obtaining solutions for this kinetic system involves only 
following particles along their gyrocenter orbits. However, an added advantage 
here is that unlike the guiding center formalism, the gyrocenter coordinates 
used in this theory involves both the equilibrium and the perturbed components 
of the electromagnetic field. In terms of solving the kinetic system using 
particle simulation methods, the gyrocenter-gauge kinetic approach enables the 
reduction of computational complexity without the loss of important physical 
content},

transport in the outer edge of the plasma of TEXTOR-94 during radiative 
improved mode discharges show a reduction by a factor of 4-7 of the radial 
particle turbulent transport. The quenching is most evident on the normalized 
potential fluctuations and is strongest above 100 kHz. Non-linear gyrokinetic 
particle-in-cell simulations of these discharges show impurity induced 
suppression of the electrostatic fluctuations associated with the ion 
temperature gradient driven mode over most of the cross-section, including the 
edge. Such a mechanism is proposed as the explanation for the improved 
confinement and turbulence reduction. The reduction in the edge turbulent 
transport levels is consistent with increased particle confinement time and the 
reduction of the SOL thickness. Particle and energy fluxes to the limiter are 
reduced by an order of magnitude. A concomitant increase of the measured energy 
and particle confinement times &tau;<sub>E</sub> and &tau;<sub>p</sub> versus 
radiated fraction suggests a common underlying suppression mechanism},

resulting from the 3D geometry on the growth rate, the frequency and the shape 
of the ITG driven mode. Here, the ITG driven mode is ballooning in the outer 
part of the torus where the amplitude of the magnetic field is almost constant 
along the toroidal direction. The results are then similar to those of a 
tokamak. On the other hand, HSX which is not dominated by toroidal effects has 
shown a clear and new 3D effect related to the 3D shape of the plasma, i.e. the 
variation of the centrifugal force along the magnetic field lines. However, 
here again this effect on the growth rate of the ITG driven mode has turned out 
to be weak. Further simulations are required to validate this point. However, 
the physical model needs to be improved by including a nonadiabatic response of 
the electrons, because with our current model we miss all the important 
destabilizing effects due to trapped electrons. Furthermore, we should include 
the effects of an equilibrium radial electric field, as in tokamaks it has a 
strong stabilizing influence on the ITG driven mode},

abstract = {Recent developments in gyrokinetic-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) 
theory and in electromagnetic gyrokinetic particle simulations raise the 
question of consistency between the gyrokinetic model and the fluid model. Due 
to the special characteristics of the guiding center coordinates, it is a 
nontrivial exercise to show this consistency. In this paper it is shown, in a 
very general setting, that the gyrokinetic theory and the fluid equations do 
give an equivalent description of plasma equilibrium (&part;/&part;t=0). The 
fluid continuity equation and momentum equation for equilibrium plasmas are 
recovered entirely from the gyrokinetic theory. However, it was Spitzer who 
first realized the importance of consistency between guiding-center motion and 
fluid equations. In particular, he studied the &ldquo;apparent paradoxical 
result&rdquo; regarding the difference between perpendicular particle flow and 
guiding-center flow, which will be referred to as the Spitzer paradox in this 
paper. By recovering the fluid equations from the gyrokinetic theory, we 
automatically resolve the Spitzer paradox, whose essence is how the 
perpendicular current and flow are microscopically generated from particles' 
guiding-center motion. The mathematical construction in the gyrokinetic theory 
which relates observable quantities in the laboratory frame to the distribution 
function in the guiding-center coordinates is consistent with Spitzer's 
original physical picture, while today's gyrokinetic-MHD theory covers a much 
wider range of problems in a much more general and quantitative way},

plasmas has been developed. The scheme, which is based on the perturbative 
(&delta;f) gyrokinetic particle simulation, splits the particle electron 
responses into adiabatic and nonadiabatic parts. The former is incorporated 
into the gyrokinetic Poisson's equation, while the latter is calculated 
dynamically with the aid of the charge conservation equation. The new scheme 
affords us the possibility of suppressing unwanted high-frequency oscillations 
and, in the meantime, relaxing the Courant condition for the thermal particles 
moving in the parallel direction. It is most useful for studying low-frequency 
phenomena in plasmas. As an example, one-dimensional drift wave simulation has 
been carried out using the scheme and the results are presented in this paper. 
This methodology can easily be generalized to problems in three-dimensional 
toroidal geometry, as well as those in unmagnetized plasmas},

response to the impurity puff, and energy confinement increases simultaneously. 
This behavior is consistent with gyrokinetic simulations which indicate that 
dilution of the working ions by impurities can reduce the growth rates of ion 
temperature gradient driven turbulence},

abstract = {The design of an experimental thermonuclear reactor requires both 
cutting-edge technology and physics predictions precise enough to carry forward 
the design. The past few years of worldwide physics studies have seen great 
progress in understanding, innovation and integration. We will discuss this 
progress and the remaining issues in several key physics areas. (1) Transport 
and plasma confinement. A worldwide database has led to an `empirical scaling 
law' for tokamaks which predicts adequate confinement for the ITER fusion 
mission, albeit with considerable but acceptable uncertainty. The ongoing 
revolution in computer capabilities has given rise to new gyrofluid and 
gyrokinetic simulations of microphysics which may be expected in the near 
future to attain predictive accuracy. Important databases on H-mode 
characteristics and He retention have also been assembled. (2) Diverters, heat 
removal and fuelling. A novel concept for heat removal-the radiative, baffled, 
partially detached divertor-has been designed for ITER. Extensive 
two-dimensional (2D) calculations have been performed and agree qualitatively 
with recent experiments. Preliminary studies of the interaction of this 
configuration with core confinement are encouraging and the success of inside 
pellet launch provides an attractive alternative fuelling method. (3) 
Macrostability. The ITER mission can be accomplished well within ideal 
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability limits, except for internal kink modes. 
Comparisons with JET, as well as a theoretical model including kinetic effects, 
predict such sawteeth will be benign in ITER. Alternative scenarios involving 
delayed current penetration or off-axis current drive may be employed if 
required. The recent discovery of neoclassical beta limits well below ideal MHD 
limits poses a threat to performance. Extrapolation to reactor scale is as yet 
unclear. In theory such modes are controllable by current drive profile control 
or feedback and experiments should be forthcoming soon. Recent results on JET 
and TFTR have confirmed qualitative understanding of alpha particle driven 
toroidal Alfven eigenmodes (TAEs). Present predictions for TAE effects in ITER 
are favourable, but require further work. The large stored energies in ITER 
have focused attention on disruption physics. Databases for thermal and current 
quenches, vertical displacement events (VDEs) and halo currents have enabled 
thermomechanical design. Some questions remain open as to the production, 
confinement and localization of runaway electrons in potentially unstable 
plasmas and mitigation strategies have been proposed. Other crucial ITER needs 
such as diagnostics, control and heating appear to have acceptable solutions. 
All this rich physics requires experimental validation by a reactor-scale 
plasma and care has been taken to provide sufficient flexibility for ITER to 
cover a wide range of scenarios},

The model embeds important kinetic effects due to finite ion Larmor radius 
(FLR), wave-particle resonances, magnetic particle trapping, etc., in the 
framework of simple fluid descriptions. When further restricted to 
low-frequency phenomena, with frequencies less than the ion cyclotron 
frequency, the kinetic-fluid model takes a simpler form in which the fluid 
equations of multiple ion species collapse into one-fluid density and momentum 
equations and a low-frequency generalized Ohm's law. The kinetic effects are 
introduced via plasma pressure tensors for ions and electrons which are 
computed from particle distribution functions that are governed by the Vlasov 
equation or simplified plasma dynamics equations such as the gyrokinetic 
equation. The ion FLR effects provide a finite parallel electric field, a 
perpendicular velocity that modifies the <b>E</b>&times;<b>B</b> drift, and a 
gyroviscosity tensor, all of which are neglected in the usual one-fluid MHD 
description. Eigenmode equations are derived, which include

abstract = {Two common computational domains used in gyrokinetic turbulence 
simulations are a local flux-tube and a global whole plasma volume. The effect 
of a radially varying pressure gradient is found to explain some of the 
qualitative differences between these two models. It is shown that a coherent 
purely radial mode is the result of profile variation. In addition, as profile 
variation is increased, there is a fairly sudden transition to much lower 
levels of heat flux. This may explain lower values found in past global 
simulations. The self-generated purely radial electrostatic potential is found 
to be 180&deg; out of phase with the flux-surface-averaged ion temperature. A 
theoretical relation between these two quantities is derived by relating the 
E&times;B nonlinearities for ion density and temperature for purely radial 
modes. This relation is used to explain the various radial mode shapes. 
Extending these results, a possible scheme is explored to reduce the heat flux 
by adding a ripple to the ion temperature profile. It may be possible to 
achieve similar results experimentally using ion cyclotron resonance heating.

influence on experimentally-observed confinement transitions in advanced 
operating modes in major tokamak experiments, such as the Tokamak Fusion Test 
Reactor (TFTR) [D.J. Grove and D.M. Meade, Nucl. Fusion <b>25</b>, 1167 
(1985)], with reversed magnetic shear regions in the plasma interior. The 
high-n toroidal drift modes destabilized by the combined effects of ion 
temperature gradients and trapped particles in toroidal geometry can be 
strongly affected by radially-sheared toroidal and poloidal plasma rotation. In 
previous work with the FULL linear microinstability code, a simplified rotation 
model including only toroidal rotation was employed, and results were obtained. 
Here, a more complete rotation model, which includes contributions from 
toroidal and poloidal rotation and the ion pressure gradient to the total 
radial electric field, is used for a proper self-consistent treatment of this 
key problem. Relevant advanced operating mode cases for TFTR are presented. In 
addition, the complementary problem of the dynamics of fluctuation-driven

considerably larger time steps and a smaller number of particles can be used in 
the simulations as compared to conventional methods. The conservation

Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) fluid model, which evolves the electrostatic potential

excellent agreement is found. The transport scaling with the adiabaticity 
parameter, which measures the strength of the parallel electron resistivity, is 
analytically derived and understood through weak- and strong-turbulence 
analyses. No evidence is found to support previous suggestions that coherent 
structures cause a large depression of saturated transport from its quasilinear

transport is well explained by the spectral balance equation of the

three-dimensional magneto-inductive gyrokinetic particle code. The code 
operates in both the standard gyrokinetic mode (total-f code) and the fully 
nonlinear characteristic mode (&delta;f code). The latter is a quiet low noise 
algorithm. The computational model represents a straight tokamak with periodic 
boundary conditions in the toroidal direction and a square cross section with 
perfectly conducting walls in the poloidal direction. The linear mode structure 
of an unstable m=1 (poloidal) and n=1 (toroidal) kinetic internal kink mode is 
clearly observed, especially in the &delta;f code. The width of the current 
layer around the n-point, where magnetic reconnection occurs, is found to be 
close to the collisionless electron skin depth, indicating the importance of 
electron inertia. Both codes give very similar nonlinear results, in which full 
reconnection in the Alfven time scale is observed along with the electrostatic 
potential structures created during this phase. The resulting E&times;B drift 
from the potential dominates the nonlinear phase after the full reconnection},

the fluctuation and thermal transport characteristics of toroidal

gyrokinetic ballooning calculations, which provide very accurate growth rates, 
critical temperature gradients, and a quasilinear estimate of 
&chi;<sub>e</sub>/&chi;<sub>i</sub>. The model is derived solely from the 
simulation results. More than 70 TFTR low confinement (L-mode) discharges have 
been simulated with quantitative success. Typically, the ion and electron 
temperature profiles are predicted within the error bars, and the global energy 
confinement time within &plusmn;10%. The measured temperatures at r/a&sime;:0.8 
are used as a boundary condition to predict the temperature profiles in the 
main confinement zone. The dramatic transition to the improved confinement in 
the supershot regime is also qualitatively explained. Further work is needed to 
extend this model of core heat transport to include particle and momentum 
transport, the edge region, and other operating regimes besides the 
ITG-dominated L mode. Nevertheless, the present model is very successful in 
predicting thermal transport in the main plasma over a wide range of

transport using both gyrofluid and gyrokinetic particle techniques. Recent 
simulations have focused on Ion Temperature Gradient (ITG) driven electrostatic 
turbulence, a potential candidate for explaining turbulence in some parameter 
regimes, and have explored experimentally-relevant physics issues such as the 
long-wavelength peak in measured spectra, the important role of sheared flows 
in turbulence, and the scaling of the transport with normalized gyroradius 
&pi;<sub>i</sub>/a and other parameters. The paper presents the first nonlinear 
gyrofluid simulations which simultaneously include trapped-electron effects 
(for arbitrary collisionality) as well as the ion temperature gradient drives, 
in 3-D toroidal simulations capable of high resolution. This permits more 
realistic comparisons with experiments, and provides the full transport matrix 
(of electron and ion heat and particle fluxes), so that such issues as particle 
pinches or convection multipliers can be investigated. A relatively 
sophisticated trapped-electron model is used which retains pitch-angle 
dependence throughout. This is potentially important for advanced tokamak 
regimes (negative shear, second stability) where a major fraction of the 
trapped particles have favorable drift. The paper also presents initial linear 
results including the passing electron fluid equations needed to obtain fully 
electromagnetic fluctuations (i.e., &ldquo;finite &beta;&rdquo; effects which 
introduce coupling between drift-like and MHD-like modes) to look for a 
possible P dependence of the transport},

stability of toroidal Alfven eigenmodes (TAE's) by yielding the well-known 
driving mechanism for the instability and by producing an effective 
dissipation, which removes the singular character of local oscillations of the 
shear-Alfven continuum and gives discrete kinetic Alfven waves (KAW's). 
Toroidal coupling of two counterpropagating KAW's generates the kinetic analog 
of the TAE, the KTAE (kinetic TAE). The nonperturbative character of this 
phenomenon and of the coupling between TAE and KAW's, and the relevance of 
finite drift-orbit effects limit the effectiveness of the analytical approach 
to asymptotic regimes, which are difficult to compare with realistic 
situations. A three-dimensional hybrid fluid-particle initial-value code for 
the numerical simulation of the linear and nonlinear evolution of toroidal

experiments is the outstanding physics based obstacle in the path to a 
commercially viable fusion reactor. Although decades of experimental and 
theoretical work indicate that anomalous transport and collective instabilities 
in the gyrokinetic regime are linked, no widely accepted description of this 
transport exists so far. Here, detailed comparisons of first-principles 
gyrofluid and gyrokinetic simulations of tokamak microinstabilities with 
experimental data are presented. With no adjustable parameters, more than 50 
TFTR L mode discharges have been simulated with encouraging success. Given the 
local plasma parameters and the temperatures at r/a=0.8, the simulations 
typically predict T<sub>i</sub>(r) and T<sub>e</sub>(r) within &plusmn;25% 
throughout the core and confinement zones. In these zones, the predicted 
thermal diffusivity increases robustly with minor radius. For parameters 
typical of r/a&gt;0.8, toroidal stability studies confirm the importance of 
impurity density gradients as a source of free energy potentially strong enough 
to explain the large edge thermal diffusivity, as first emphasized by Coppi 
(1992) and his coworkers. Advanced confinement discharges have also been 
simulated. The dramatic increase of T<sub>i</sub>(0) observed in supershots 
(from 5 to 30 keV) is recovered by our model for dozens of simulated

velocity-shear stabilization of toroidal microinstabilities is quantitatively

abstract = {A comprehensive study of transport in full-volume gyrokinetic (GK) 
simulations of ion temperature gradient driven turbulence in core tokamak 
plasmas is presented. Though this &ldquo;gyrokinetic tokamak&rdquo; is much 
simpler than experimental tokamaks, such simplicity is an asset, because a 
dependable nonlinear transport theory for such systems should be more 
attainable. Toward this end, two related lines of inquiry are pursued. (1) The 
scalings of GK tokamaks with respect to important system parameters are 
studied. In contrast to real machines, the scalings of larger GK systems 
(a/&rho;<sub>s</sub>&gsim;64) with minor radius, with current, and with 
a/&rho;<sub>s</sub> are roughly consistent with the approximate theoretical 
expectations for electrostatic turbulent transport which exist as yet. Smaller 
systems manifest quite different scalings. (2) With the goal of developing a 
first-principles theory of GK transport, the GK data are used to infer the 
underlying transport physics. The data indicate that, of the many modes k 
present in the simulation, only a modest number (N<sub>k</sub>~10) of k 
dominate the transport, and for each, only a handful (N<sub>p</sub>~5) of 
couplings to other modes p appear to be significant, implying that the 
essential transport physics may be described by a far simpler system than would 
have been expected on the basis of earlier nonlinear theory alone. Part of this 
analysis is the inference of the coupling coefficients M<sub>kpq</sub> 
governing the nonlinear mode interactions, whose measurement from tokamak 
simulation data are presented here for the first time},

the dependence on all relevant physical parameters. The transition from local

abstract = {A gyrokinetic weak-turbulence theory of ion-temperature-gradient 
modes for inverted density profile (&eta;<sub>i</sub> &lt; O) plasmas exists. 
Set in sheared slab geometry, this theory predicts that the thermal diffusivity 
associated with &eta;<sub>i</sub> &lt; O modes is much lower than 
strong-turbulence (mixing-length) estimates of the more conventional 
&eta;<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0 modes. In this work, we seek to test the details of 
this prediction from within the sheared-slab gyrofluid paradigm. First, we 
extend the earlier linear analysis to arbitrary 
k<sub>&perp;</sub>&rho;<sub>i</sub> by employing the gyrokinetic integral code 
of Linsker (1981) and compare these results with the gyrofluid predictions; 
excellent agreement between the full gyrokinetic and gyrofluid theories is 
found, Next, the corresponding gyrofluid weak turbulence theory is developed 
and shown to reproduce the gyrokinetic predictions with reasonable precision. 
Although the dominant nonlinearity is three-wave coupling, Landau damping is 
shown to be important. We then integrate the gyrofluid equations directly to 
compare with the theoretical predictions, making no assumptions about the 
important nonlinear processes or the relevance of the weak-turbulence expansion 
beyond those necessary to derive the gyrofluid equations. Preliminary runs 
indicate that at least qualitative agreement is found with the theoretical 
predictions; the predicted thermal diffusivity is small compared to 
&eta;<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0 simulations. The simulations are characterized by a 
large number of modes with substantial energy, and hence cannot be described 
well by a three-mode theory. Refinements of the analytic theory based upon the 
simulation results are suggested},

simulation-fluid, gyrokinetics, etc.-belong to the class of partial

The principal manifestation of the chaos is the sensitivity to the initial 
conditions, or the Lyapunov exponentiation of neighboring orbits in the 
infinite dimensional phase space of the system. Therefore any initial 
inaccuracy, which may be due to finite grid size, time step, or roundoff error, 
is exponentially enhanced by the dynamics, and there is very little hope, 
whatever the available computer power, to have quantitatively accurate 
predictions in terms of individual orbits, as far as many exponentiation time 
scales are concerned. The general attitude towards the results of computer 
simulation, then, is that they correctly represent certain average quantities. 
This work is an attempt to specify criteria for this optimistic attitude to be 
justified},

in that it includes the stabilizing effects of poloidal rotation shear for 
toroidal modes with toroidal curvature and trapped particles (e.g. ITG, trapped 
particle modes). Destabilizing parallel velocity shear is also included. Data 
from D-III VH modes will be analyzed to see if velocity shear effects on linear 
growth rates can account for the observed confinement improvement. The code has 
been run for TFTR experimental L-mode data for beam scans with increasing 
rotation shear. The code finds that the destabilizing parallel velocity shear 
effects overwhelm the stabilizing perpendicular velocity shear effects, and 
strongly destabilize the modes. Surprisingly, the experimental X did not 
increase. Nonlinear effects due to the buildup of microscopic ambipolar 
potentials have been found to be a crucial effect in gyrofluid simulations, and 
this nonlinear effect is being included in this kinetic code. However, present 
gyrofluid models have potentially substantial inaccuracies in the treatment of 
this physics, which are corrected here. Preliminary results from multi-mode 
simulations will be reported},

simulation. The gyrokinetic Vlasov simulation is successfully benchmarked for 
the unstable modes. Linear two-dimensional modes using higher order terms in 
the ballooning formalism are studied. The growth rate of the global 
two-dimensional mode can be larger than those of the lowest-order 
one-dimensional modes. This is possibly due to the fact that the higher order 
terms represent a radial variation in the driving terms, allowing the mode to 
couple to a stronger source than allowed in the lowest order representation. 
Preliminary investigations of the nonlinear simulation show that the 
fluctuation amplitude in the quasi-saturation stage continues to grow at a much 
slower rate, than the linear growth rate},

abstract = {An implicit &delta;f electrostatic algorithm has been developed for 
gyrokinetic ions and drift-kinetic electrons. The basic algorithm presented is 
generally applicable to diverse particle simulation models. The methodology is 
derived from the work of Barnes and co-workers (1992) and extends earlier work 
on orbit-averaged implicit particle codes. A &delta;f particle description (in 
this case for the electrons) is used to close the continuity and momentum 
conservation fluid equations by providing a kinetic pressure tensor. The 
particle equations of motion are advanced explicitly and can be subcycled in 
time with respect to the field equations (and the gyrokinetic ion advance in 
this case). The accumulation of the pressure tensor can be numerically orbit 
averaged to ease the statistical constraints on the orbit-averaged kinetic 
species. By adding and subtracting an isothermal fluid approximation to the 
pressure tensor, and evaluating the added fluid pressure implicitly, as was 
done in previous work on the implicit moment algorithm, an additional 
improvement in stability and convergence is achieved. The fluid equations are 
implicitly differenced in time and solved simultaneously with the gyrokinetic 
Poisson's equation using a combination of Fourier methods and a one-dimensional 
periodic tri-diagonal matrix solution in the direction of the shear variation 
of the magnetic field. The requisite Bessel functions have been replaced with a 
Pade approximation. Dispersion analyses and supporting simulation results 
illustrate the desirable properties of this algorithm. We check the new 
algorithm against published results of simulations of ion-temperature-gradient 
instability with kinetic ions and electrons},

temperature gradient drift instabilities (ITG modes) in toroidal geometry have 
been carried out with focus on the issues of transport scaling, isotope effects 
and impurity inward pinch. The model, which simulates the total core region of 
a tokamak, includes the perturbed electrostatic potentials along with the full 
gyrokinetic dynamics for the ions and the adiabatic response for the electrons. 
In the area of transport scaling, we have carried out simulations with 
different minor radius similar to the &rho;<sup>*</sup> scan in the 
experiments. Based on the TFTR supershot parameters used by the Numerical 
Tokamak Project, the results indicate that the 
k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&rho;<sub>s</sub> spectrum remains unchanged with a peak 
around 0.15. While the k<sub>&thetas;</sub>&rho;<sub>s</sub> spectrum always 
peaks at zero, its width, &Delta;k<sub>&zeta;</sub>&rho;<sub>s</sub>, decreases 
with the minor radius. As argued by Perkins et al. (1993), this is the 
signature for nonGyro-Bohm scaling. This scaling trend can also be understood 
by the Conner-Taylor invariance analysis. A consequence for such a nonGyro-Bohm 
scaling is that it will lead to a favorable isotope scaling for the thermal 
diffusivity, i.e., a reduction of &chi;<sub>i</sub> with an increase in mass. 
This is borne out by the simulation. Specifically, by changing from deuterium 
to tritium, we have seen a 10% reduction in &chi;<sub>i</sub> at saturation and 
a 25% reduction shortly afterwards. With an increase of the tritium temperature 
by a factor of 2, the total reduction in comparison with the deuterium case 
becomes 15% and 45%, respectively. This favorable scaling trend is similar to 
that observed in the recent D-T experiments on TFTR. In recent impurity 
transport studies, the Z/m dependence for the pinch velocity observed in the 
slab simulation is somewhat reduced in the toroidal case. This is attributed to 
the modification of the E<sub>&par;</sub> acceleration by the toroidal effects 
on the ExB advection},

abstract = {One of the grand challenge problems now supported by HPCC is the 
Numerical Tokamak Project. A goal of this project is the study of low-frequency 
microinstabilities in tokamak plasmas, which are believed to cause energy loss 
via turbulent thermal transport across the magnetic field lines. An important 
tool in this study is gyrokinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. 
Gyrokinetic, as opposed to fully-kinetic, methods are particularly well suited 
to the task because they are optimized to study the frequency and wavelength 
domain of the microinstabilities. The author summarizes work on codes for the 
Connection Machine and BBN TC2000, and the development of a generic DDMP code 
for distributed-memory parallel machines. He discusses the memory-access issues 
which are of key importance in writing parallel PIC codes, with special 
emphasis on issues peculiar to gyrokinetic PIC. He outlines the domain 
decompositions in the new DDMP code and discusses the interplay of different 
domain decompositions suited for the particle-pushing and field-solution 
components of the PIC algorithm},

abstract = {Data from several current tokamak experiments indicate that the 
equilibrium perpendicular velocity field can become strongly sheared 
accompanying the transition from the L mode to the H mode, i.e. improved, 
confinement, and that fluctuation levels are reduced. Linear theory suggests 
that velocity shear can stabilize ion-temperature-gradient (ITG) modes when the 
frequency shift experienced by the mode due to the radial dependence of the 
Doppler shift is comparable to the growth rate. To confirm the predictions of 
linear theory and to explore nonlinear issues, e.g., self-generated shear 
flows, saturation amplitudes, and the concomitant energy transport levels, two- 
and three-dimensional gyrokinetic simulations of ITG modes have been performed. 
The simulations were done with and without magnetic shear in a slab 
configuration using the partially linearized (&delta;<i>f</i>) algorithm to 
reduce statistical noise. The simulations confirm theoretical analyses of the 
stabilizing and destabilizing effects of imposed perpendicular velocity fields. 
The ion energy transport levels at saturation follow the trends of the linear 
growth rates and the mixing-length estimates. The gyrokinetic simulations are 
in qualitative agreement with the results of gyrofluid simulations, and exhibit 
saturation amplitudes and energy transport similar to those in gyrofluid 
simulations. These transport levels are generally lower than those typically 
reported in the laboratory experiments; including toroidal driving terms 
significantly increases the transport levels in the simulations},

the numerical properties of the simulation plasma. For instance, 
implementations of such algorithms (1) enable one to suppress the intrinsic

the weights of the fast-moving particles and, in turn, to eliminate the 
associated high frequency oscillations. Examples of their application to

abstract = {Realistic kinetic toroidal eigenmode calculations have been carried 
out to support a proper assessment of the influence of long-wavelength 
microturbulence on transport in tokamak plasmas. In order to efficiently 
evaluate large-scale kinetic behavior extending over many rational surfaces, 
significant improvements have been made to a toroidal finite element code used 
to analyze the fully two-dimensional (<i>r</i>,&thetas;) mode structures of 
trapped-ion and toroidal ion temperature gradient (ITG) instabilities. It is 
found that even at very long wavelengths, these eigenmodes exhibit a strong 
ballooning character with the associated radial structure relatively 
insensitive to ion Landau damping at the rational surfaces. In contrast to the 
long-accepted picture that the radial extent of trapped-ion instabilities is 
characterized by the ion-gyroradius-scale associated with strong localization 
between adjacent rational surfaces, present results demonstrate that under 
realistic conditions, the actual scale is governed by the large-scale 
variations in the equilibrium gradients. Applications to recent measurements of 
fluctuation properties in Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) [Plasma Phys. 
Controlled Nucl. Fusion Res. (International Atomic Energy Agency, Vienna, 
1985), Vol.1, p.29] L-mode plasmas indicate that the theoretical trends appear 
consistent with spectral characteristics as well as rough heuristic estimates 
of the transport level. Benchmarking calculations in support of the development 
of a three-dimensional toroidal gyrokinetic code indicate reasonable agreement

simulation techniques for solving the gyrokinetic Vlasov-Maxwell equations on 
massively parallel computers has been carried out at the Princeton Plasma 
Physics Laboratory. This is a key element of the ongoing theoretical efforts to 
systematically investigate physics issues vital to understanding tokamak 
plasmas. The paper focuses on spatial-gradient-driven microinstabilities. Their 
importance is supported by the recent progress in achieving a physics-based 
understanding of anomalous transport in toroidal systems, which has been based 
on the proposition that these drift-type electrostatic modes dependent on ion 
temperature gradient (ITG) and trapped particle effects are dominant in the 
bulk (`confinement') region. Although their presence is consistent with a 
number of significant confinement trends, results from high temperature 
tokamaks such as TFTR have highlighted the need for better insight into the 
nonlinear properties of such instabilities in long-mean-free-path plasmas. In 
addressing this general issue, the paper reports important new results, 
including the first fully toroidal 3D gyrokinetic simulation of ITG modes and 
realistic toroidal eigenmode calculations demonstrating the unique capability 
to deal with large scale kinetic behaviour extending over many rational

the coupling between the dynamics of these two components through plasma

low-frequency fluctuations in high temperature tokamaks is developed by solving 
the gyrokinetic equations for the ion and electron directly as an initial value

kinetic features of the problem without approximations. The 
ion-temperature-gradient mode is investigated as an example of this new 
simulation technique. Both the adiabatic electron model and the full 
drift-kinetic electron model are studied. Numerical results show that the full

abstract = {In previous studies, it was shown that, in the nonlinearly 
saturated phase of the evolution of drift instabilities in gyrokinetic particle 
simulations, the saturation levels and especially the particle fluxes are 
significantly less than predicted by quasilinear theory, and have an unexpected 
dependence on collisionality. In this paper, a theory is developed that 
explains these phenomena. The key features of the theory are as follows: The 
saturation level is determined by a balance between the steady-state electron 
and ion fluxes. The ion flux is small for levels of the potential below an 
E&times;B-trapping threshold and increases sharply once this threshold is 
crossed. Because of the presence of resonant electrons, the electron flux has a 
much smoother dependence on the potential. In the 
2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>-dimensional `pseudo-3-D') geometry, the electrons 
are accelerated away from the resonance as they diffuse spatially, resulting in 
an inhibition of their diffusion, and thereby reducing the values of the 
potential and flux at which the fluxes can balance. Collisions and 
three-dimensional effects can repopulate the resonance thereby increasing the 
value of the particle flux},

enables one to further separate the time and spatial scales of the simulation

is also found that the saturation amplitude and the associated quasilinear

weak collisions. In the highly collisional (fluid) limit, there is an upper

shear-free magnetic field has been studied by means of gyrokinetic particle 
simulation as well as numerical integration of model mode-coupling equations. 
The purpose of the investigation is to identify relevant nonlinear mechanisms 
responsible for the steady-state drift wave fluctuations. It is found that the 
saturation of the instability is caused mainly by the nonlinear 
<b>E</b>&times;<b>B</b> convection of the resonant electrons and their 
associated velocity space nonlinearity. The latter also induces energy exchange 
between the competing modes, which, in turn, gives rise to enhanced diffusion. 
The nonlinear <b>E</b>&times;<b>B</b> convection of the ions, which contributes 
to the nonlinear frequency shift, is also an important ingredient for the 
saturation},

instabilities for realistic Tokamak equilibria and the application of such 
calculations to the PDX and PLT Tokamak experiments, including the influence of 
a hot beam-ion component; (2) determination of `non-linearly saturated', 
statistically steady states of three interacting drift modes; and (3) 
gyrokinetic particle simulation of drift instabilities},

abstract = {Nonlinear gyrokinetic equations are derived from a systematic 
Hamiltonian theory. The derivation employs Lie transforms and a noncanonical 
perturbation theory first used by Littlejohn (1981) for the simpler problem of 
asymptotically small gyroradius. For definiteness, only electrostatic 
fluctuations in slab geometry are considered; however, there is a 
straightforward generalization to arbitrary field geometry and electromagnetic 
perturbations. An energy invariant for the nonlinear system is derived, and 
several limiting forms are considered. The weak turbulence theory of the 
equations is examined. In particular, the wave kinetic equation of Galeev and 
Sagdeev (1969) can only be derived by an asystematic truncation of the 
equations, implying that this equation fails to consider all gyrokinetic 
effects. The equations are simplified for the case of small but finite 
gyroradius and put in a form suitable for efficient computer simulation. 
Although it is possible to derive the Terry-Horton (1982) and Hasegawa-Mima 
(1978) equations as limiting cases of the authors theory, several new nonlinear 
terms absent from conventional theories appear and are discussed. The resulting 
theory is very similar in content to the recent work of Lee (1983). However, 
the systematic nature of the authors derivation provides considerable insight 
into the structure and interpretation of the equations},

gyrokinetic collision theory are observed frequently in devices of gaseous

ascribed to fine-scale instabilities in most fusion experiments there is some 
experimental as well as computer simulation evidence that they can be caused by 
low-frequency large-scale correlations of the quiescent plasma. The authors 
investigate the modification of their previous theory when the plasma 
components have different temperatures. Their formalism developed in 1983 
largely remains unaltered when different electron and ion temperatures are 
allowed for},
