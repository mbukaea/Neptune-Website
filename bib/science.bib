abstract = "Abstract Numerical methods for partial differential equations in 
high-dimensional spaces are often limited by the curse of dimensionality. 
Though the sparse grid technique, based on a one-dimensional hierarchical basis 
through tensor products, is popular for handling challenges such as those 
associated with spatial discretization, the stability conditions on time step 
size due to temporal discretization, such as those associated with high-order 
derivatives in space and stiff reactions, remain. Here, we incorporate the 
sparse grids with the implicit integration factor method (IIF) that is 
advantageous in terms of stability conditions for systems containing stiff 
reactions and diffusions. We combine IIF, in which the reaction is treated 
implicitly and the diffusion is treated explicitly and exactly, with various 
sparse grid techniques based on the finite element and finite difference 
methods and a multi-level combination approach. The overall method is found to 
be efficient in terms of both storage and computational time for solving a wide 
range of \{PDEs\} in high dimensions. In particular, the \{IIF\} with the 
sparse grid combination technique is flexible and effective in solving systems 
that may include cross-derivatives and non-constant diffusion coefficients. 
Extensive numerical simulations in both linear and nonlinear systems in high 
dimensions, along with applications of diffusive logistic equations and 
FokkerPlanck equations, demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and robustness 
of the new methods, indicating potential broad applications of the sparse 
grid-based integration factor method. "

abstract = "Abstract This paper presents a high-order discontinuous Galerkin 
(DG) method based on a multi-dimensional gas kinetic evolution model for 
viscous flow computations. Generally, the \{DG\} methods for equations with 
higher order derivatives must transform the equations into a first order system 
in order to avoid the so-called non-conforming problem. In the traditional 
\{DG\} framework, the inviscid and viscous fluxes are numerically treated 
differently. Differently from the traditional \{DG\} approaches, the current 
method adopts a kinetic evolution model for both inviscid and viscous flux 
evaluations uniformly. By using a multi-dimensional gas kinetic formulation, we 
can obtain a spatial and temporal dependent gas distribution function for the 
flux integration inside the cell and at the cell interface, which is 
distinguishable from the Gaussian Quadrature point flux evaluation in the 
traditional \{DG\} method. Besides the initial higher order non-equilibrium 
states inside each control volume, a Linear Least Square (LLS) method is used 
for the reconstruction of smooth distributions of macroscopic flow variables 
around each cell interface in order to construct the corresponding equilibrium 
state. Instead of separating the space and time integrations and using the 
multistage RungeKutta time stepping method for time accuracy, the current 
method integrates the flux function in space and time analytically, which 
subsequently saves the computational time. Many test cases in two and three 
dimensions, which include high Mach number compressible viscous and heat 
conducting flows and the low speed high Reynolds number laminar flows, are 
presented to demonstrate the performance of the current scheme. "

meshless methods was ten to one hundred times shorter than that of \{FEM\} to

introduced, making use of the Marker And Cell layout for the data. The solver 
is validated numerically in two and three spatial dimensions. "
