abstract = {Thermal convection experiments in a liquid gallium layer subject to 
a uniform rotation and a uniform vertical magnetic field are carried out as a 
function of rotation rate and magnetic field strength. Our purpose is to 
measure heat transfer in a low-Prandtl-number (Pr=0.023), electrically 
conducting fluid as a function of the applied temperature difference, rotation 
rate, applied magnetic field strength and fluid-layer aspect ratio. For 
Rayleigh-Benard (non-rotating, non-magnetic) convection we obtain a Nusselt

non-rotating magnetoconvection, we find that the critical Rayleigh number Rac 
increases linearly with magnetic energy density, and a heat transfer law of the 
form Nu~Ra<sup>1/2</sup>. Coherent thermal oscillations are detected in 
magnetoconvection at ~1.4Ra<sub>C</sub>. For rotating magnetoconvection, we 
find that the convective heat transfer is inhibited by rotation, in general 
agreement with theoretical predictions. At low rotation rates, the critical 
Rayleigh number increases linearly with magnetic field intensity. At moderate 
rotation rates, coherent thermal oscillations are detected near the onset of 
convection. The oscillation frequencies are close to the frequency of rotation, 
indicating inertially driven, oscillatory convection. In nearly all of our 
experiments, no well-defined, steady convective regime is found. Instead, we 
detect unsteady or turbulent convection just after onset},

abstract = {In an experiment carried out by Aurnou and Olson [J. Fluid Mech. 
430, 283 (2001)] thermal convection in a liquid gallium layer in the presence 
of a uniform vertical magnetic field was investigated. The critical Rayleigh 
number at the onset of magnetoconvection was determined as a function of the 
Chandrasekhar number Q (the ratio of the Lorentz force to the viscous force) 
and the Taylor number T<sub>a</sub> (the squared ratio of the Coriolis force to 
the viscous force). In the experimental apparatus, the upper and lower 
boundaries of the liquid gallium layer were electrically conducting copper 
plate walls. This paper presents a study of the effect of electrically 
conducting walls on rotating magnetoconvection. It is shown that the electrical 
properties of the walls have significant effects on the characteristics of 
rotating magnetoconvection when both the Chandrasekhar number Q and the Taylor 
number T<sub>a</sub> are sufficiently large. It is demonstrated that, as a 
consequence of the electrically conducting walls, oscillatory magnetoconvection 
can become steady and the critical Rayleigh number can change by as much as 
60%. The problem of convectively driven Alfven waves in a rotating fluid layer

abstract = {We describe a new instability of rolls in three related convection 
problems. The instability results in a large-scale modulation of the amplitude 
of the convection (in contrast to a phase instability such as that of Eckhaus) 
and may be supercritical, with strongly amplitude-modulated rolls predicted at 
onset. Essential to the instability is the presence of a conserved quantity 
(whose existence is contingent upon an appropriate choice of boundary 
conditions). Which gives rise to a corresponding slowly evolving large-scale 
mode. In rotating convection between stress-free boundaries, the conserved 
quantity is the velocity component along the axes of the rolls; in 
magnetoconvection it is the magnetic flux through the layer. In rotating 
magnetoconvection both quantities may be conserved. In each case the 
appropriate amplitude equations to describe convection near onset consist of a 
modulation equation of Ginzburg-Landau type for the amplitude of the rolls, 
coupled to a large-scale modulation equation for each conserved quantity. The 
large-scale mode(s), although damped according to linear theory, can 
destabilise the rolls at onset. It is found that rolls are unstable for 
sufficiently small Prandtl number in rotating convection, and for sufficiently 
small magnetic diffusivity in magnetoconvection. Throughout we consider only 
the onset of convection through a stationary bifurcation, but we find, 
remarkably, that in rotating magnetoconvection stable travelling waves may be 
found at onset due to this new instability},

abstract = {The development of magnetoconvection in a sheared magnetic field is 
investigated. The equilibrium magnetic field <b>B</b><sub>0</sub> is horizontal 
and its orientation varies linearly along the vertical axis. Preliminary 
consideration of the transition from the inertial to the viscous regime of the 
gravitational resistive interchange instability, reveals that the latter is 
characterized by the existence of viscoresistive boundary layers of vertical 
width which scales as Q<sup>-1/6</sup>, where Q is the Chandrasekhar number. 
The situation is analogous to the one encountered in magnetically confined 
laboratory plasmas, where convective flows are constrained by the magnetic 
shear to develop in boundary layers located around resonant magnetic surfaces 
in order to fulfill the &ldquo;interchange condition&rdquo; 
<b>k&ldr;B</b><sub>0</sub>=0, where <b>k</b> is the wave vector of the magnetic 
perturbation. It follows that when the effect of thermal diffusion is taken 
into account in the process, convection can only occur above a certain critical 
value of the Rayleigh number which scales as Q<sup>2/3</sup> for large Q. At 
the onset, the convection pattern is a superposition of identically thin 
convective rolls everywhere aligned with the local magnetic field lines and 
which therefore adopt the magnetic field geometry, a situation also reminiscent 
of the penumbra of sunspots. Using this degeneracy, equations describing the 
weakly nonlinear state are obtained and discussed. A reduced 
magnetohydrodynamic description of magnetoconvection is introduced. Since it is 
valid for arbitrary magnetic field configurations, it allows a simple extension 
to the case where there exists an inclination between the direction of gravity 
and the plane spanned by the equilibrium magnetic field. These reduced 
magnetohydrodynamic equations are proposed as a powerful tool for further 
investigations of magnetoconvection in more complex field line geometries.},

abstract = {Numerical modeling of the interaction between turbulent convection 
and magnetic fields at the solar surface can be carried out in several 
different styles. The simplest approach is to model photospheric motions 
kinematically, representing the effects of granules, mesogranules and 
supergranules by axisymmetric sources at the solar surface. The effective 
diffusivity depends on the sizes and lifetimes of these sources, as flux is 
swept to cell boundaries, moved along those boundaries, and accumulated at 
stagnation points whose own positions change. The underlying dynamics can be 
studied either through detailed simulations or through idealized numerical 
experiments. Numerical experiments on two- and three-dimensional 
magnetoconvection in a strong vertical field reveal a variety of time-dependent 
behavior (including traveling waves, standing waves, modulated waves and 
pulsating waves) which can be understood by reference to the underlying 
bifurcation structure. The pattern of convection changes if the field geometry 
is altered. Turbulent magnetoconvection raises more severe problems. In weaker 
imposed fields, strong flux concentrations persist near stagnation points in 
the flow but the strength of the rms field in turbulent convection remains a 
controversial issue},

abstract = {Convection of an electrically conducting fluid of magnetic 
diffusivity &eta; and thermal diffusivity &kappa; in rapidly rotating systems 
in the presence of an imposed toroidal magnetic field is investigated. The 
motivation for this study comes from the study of convection in planetary 
cores. Two important parameters of the system are the Elsasser number &Lambda;, 
which measures the strength of the imposed field and the modified Rayleigh 
number R, which measures the amplitude of buoyancy forces. In this system both 
magnetically driven instability due to the field curvature and thermally driven 
instability due to buoyancy can occur. Attention is focused on the behaviour of 
linear magnetoconvection at small Roberts number, q=&kappa;/&eta;&rarr;0. 
appropriate for the Earth's core. Two different approaches are adopted for 
investigation. First, an asymptotic analysis with q&rarr;0 is carried out to 
show that R<sub>c</sub>=0(1/q), q&rarr;0, &Lambda;&rarr;&Lambda;<sub>c</sub>, 
where R<sub>c</sub> is the critical value of the modified Rayleigh number and 
&Lambda;<sub>c</sub> denotes the critical value for the purely magnetic 
instabilities. Moreover, the nature of the transition between magnetically 
driven modes and thermally driven modes is investigated. Second, numerical 
solutions at different values of q in a rapidly rotating spherical shell are 
obtained for two different cases: (i) stress-free boundary conditions with an 
insulating inner sphere and (ii) no-slip boundary conditions with a conducting 
inner sphere. Both numerical solutions confirm the singular behaviour of 
magnetoconvection in the limit q&rarr;0, as predicted by the asymptotic 
analysis. In consequence, the transition from the thermally dominant mode to 
the magnetically dominant mode has a rather complex structure in the limit 
q&rarr;0. It is shown that there is no uniform scaling that is appropriate for 
all O(1) values of &Lambda;. The results shed new light on well-known numerical 
difficulties in the problem of magnetoconvection at the small Roberts number

solar-type stars in ever greater detail. The authors present the results of 
idealized numerical experiments on two-dimensional magnetoconvection in a fully 
compressible perfect gas. They first vary the aspect ratio &lambda; of the 
computational box and show that the system runs through a sequence of 
convective patterns, and that it is only for a sufficiently wide box 
(&lambda;&ges;6) that the flow becomes insensitive to further increases in 
&lambda;. Next, setting &lambda;=6, we decrease the field strength from a value 
strong enough to halt convection and find transitions to small-scale steady 
convection, next to spatially modulated oscillations (first periodic, then 
chaotic) and then to a new regime of flux separation, with regions of strong 
field (where convection is almost completely suppressed) separated by broad 
convective plumes. They also explore the effects of altering the boundary 
conditions and show that this sequence of transitions is robust. Finally, they 
relate these model calculations to recent high-resolution observations of solar 
magnetoconvection, in plage regions as well as in light bridges and the umbrae 
of sunspots},

inclined at a variety of angles to the vertical. Tilting the field is also 
interesting from a purely theoretical viewpoint since it breaks many of the 
symmetries usually associated with convection problems. In this paper we study 
the linear stability of a layer permeated by an inclined magnetic field and go

abstract = {Convection in a compressible fluid with an imposed vertical 
magnetic field is studied numerically in a three-dimensional Cartesian geometry 
with periodic lateral boundary conditions. Attention is restricted to the 
mildly nonlinear regime, with parameters chosen first so that convection at 
onset is steady, and then so that it is oscillatory. Steady convection occurs 
in the form of two-dimensional rolls when the magnetic field is weak. These 
rolls can become unstable to a mean horizontal shear flow, which in two 
dimensions leads to a pulsating wave in which the direction of the mean flow 
reverses. In three dimensions a new pattern is found in which the alignment of 
the rolls and the shear flow alternates. If the magnetic field is sufficiently 
strong, squares or hexagons are stable at the onset of convection. Both the 
squares and the hexagons have an asymmetrical topology, with upflow in plumes 
and downflow in sheets. For the squares this involves a resonance between rolls 
aligned with the box and rolls aligned diagonally to the box. The preference 
for three-dimensional flow when the field is strong is a consequence of the 
compressibility of the layer-for Boussinesq magnetoconvection rolls are always 
preferred over squares at onset. In the regime where convection is oscillatory, 
the preferred planform for moderate fields is found to be alternating 
rolls-standing waves in both horizontal directions which are out of phase. For 
stronger fields, both alternating rolls and two-dimensional travelling rolls 
are stable. As the amplitude of convection is increased, either by decreasing 
the magnetic field strength or by increasing the temperature contrast, the 
regular planform structure seen at onset is soon destroyed by secondary 
instabilities},

shown to be equally effective as Hopf bifurcation. Initially the physical 
system of magnetoconvection with positive Chandrasekhar number is analyzed and 
next a prototype of a new dynamical system given for q &lt; 0 is also 
considered. To regulate the complex dynamics, adaptive controllers are 
constructed for the systems and the stable configuration achieved, is confirmed 
both analytically and numerically. The anti-control technique is investigated 
which can be applied to generate chaos irrespective of all the parameter values 
and state of the system. The procedure deals with the application of a linear 
feedback term to the system to destabilize the equilibria},

investigated numerically and experimentally in electrically conductive liquid 
gallium (Prandtl number P=0.025), at Rayleigh numbers R up to around 6 times 
critical and at Ekman numbers E~10<sup>-6</sup>. This work follows up the 
non-magnetic study of convection presented in a companion paper (Gillet et al. 
2007). We study here the addition of a z-invariant toroidal magnetic field to 
the fluid flow. The experimental measurements of fluid velocities by ultrasonic 
Doppler velocimetry, together with the quasi-geostrophic numerical simulations 
incorporating a three-dimensional modelling of the magnetic induction 
processes, demonstrate a stabilizing effect of the magnetic field in the 
weak-field case, characterized by an Elsasser number &Lambda;&lt;(E/P)1/3. We 
find that this is explained by the changes of the critical parameters at the 
onset of convection as A increases. As in the non-magnetic study, strong zonal 
jets of characteristic length scales l<sub>&beta;</sub> (Rhines length scale) 
dominates the fluid dynamics. A new characteristic of the magnetoconvective 
flow is the elongation of the convective cells in the direction of the imposed 
magnetic field, introducing a new length scale l<sub>&phi;</sub>. Combining

fronts in mid-latitude atmospheric cyclones. It can be estimated from an

abstract = {Perhaps the most fundamental problem in dynamo theory is the 
smallness of the Ekman number E which is O(10<sup>-15</sup>) based on estimates 
of the molecular diffusivity of the Earth's core. It is difficult to achieve 
values much lower than O(10<sup>-4</sup>) in numerical models. The 
&ldquo;headline&rdquo; value of E can be reduced using hyperviscosity but it is 
becoming clear that this is not helping the aim of moving towards the 
geophysically relevant parameter regime of low viscosity, and several factors 
indicate that E=O(10<sup>-4</sup>) is not small enough. The magnetostrophic 
approximation is an alternative approach that neglects viscous effects 
altogether (E=0) in the interior of the core. A consequence of this is Taylor's 
constraint. So far, fundamental problems have prevented the successful working 
of a convection-driven dynamo model using this approach. Nevertheless, the 
difficulties with hyperviscosity mean that it is important to continue to learn 
as much as possible about the E&rarr;0 limit through the (E=0) magnetostrophic 
approximation. If viscous effects are retained only in Ekman boundary layers, a 
standard analysis modifies Taylor's constraint to give a prescription for the 
mean azimuthal flow. This so-called &ldquo;geostrophic flow&rdquo; 
V<sub>G</sub>(s,t)I<sub>&phi;</sub> is the dominant nonlinear effect when the 
magnetic field is weak and can act to equilibrate an otherwise exponentially 
growing linear solution in an &ldquo;Ekman state&rdquo;. Two variants of this 
approach have been studied: mean-field dynamos and magnetoconvection. The 
authors consider the latter. They use a cylindrical geometry. In the presence 
of an imposed magnetic field B<sub>0</sub>, they time-step the governing 
equations to find the dependence of the nonlinear (Ekman state) solutions as a 
function of the Rayleigh number Ra. They investigate the role of alternative 
magnetic boundary conditions and of whether there is an inner cylindrical 
boundary or not. These introduce modest quantitative differences. The major 
qualitative difference arises from the orientation of gravity g and the imposed 
temperature gradient &nabla;T. When in the axial (z) direction, a transition 
towards a Taylor state is found at Ra close to Ra<sub>c</sub>. When g and 
&nabla;T<sub>0</sub> are aligned in the radial (s) direction, supercritical 
Ekman states are found for a large range of values of Ra, and there is no 
evidence of the system moving towards a Taylor state},

magnetoconvection in a strong background magnetic field corresponding to the

dominated by narrow upflow plumes with adjacent downflows, which become almost 
field-free near the surface layers. The strong external magnetic field forces 
the plumes to assume a cusplike shape in their top parts, where the upflowing 
plasma loses its buoyancy. The resulting bright features in intensity images 
correspond well (in terms of brightness, size, and lifetime) to the observed 
umbral dots in the central parts of sunspot umbrae. Most of the simulated 
umbral dots have a horizontally elongated form with a central dark lane. Above 
the cusp, most plumes show narrow upflow jets, which are driven by the pressure 
of the piled-up plasma below. The large velocities and low field strengths in 
the plumes are effectively screened from spectroscopic observation because the 
surfaces of equal optical depth are locally elevated, so that spectral lines 
are largely formed above the cusp. Our simulations demonstrate that nearly 
field-free upflow plumes and umbral dots are a natural result of convection in 
a strong, initially monolithic magnetic field},

abstract = {Weakly nonlinear Boussinesq convection in an imposed vertical 
magnetic field is studied. Stress-free boundary conditions are used at top and 
bottom of the layer where the magnetic field is assumed to remain vertical. 
Both steady and oscillatory convection are considered. Among all the spatially 
periodic patterns steady rolls are the preferred pattern when the onset of 
convection is steady state; in the overstable regime a variety of spatially and 
temporally periodic patterns may be stable depending on the parameters. These 
include in particular a pattern called alternating rolls; the location of 
stable alternating rolls appears to be consistent with recent numerical 
simulations of compressible magnetoconvection where such patterns have been 
found. In certain cases the conduction solution loses stability directly to 
spatially periodic patterns with nonperiodic time dependence. The analysis of 
the possible patterns and their stability takes advantage of existing results 
from equivariant bifurcation theory and uses the critical wavenumber selected 
by the linear stability calculation as a function of the imposed magnetic 
field},

of nonlinear differential equations is integrated numerically and in certain

oscillations followed by a period-doubling cascade. After the accumulation 
point there is a semiperiodic cascade leading to chaotic behaviour. Then the 
semiperiodic cascade is repeated in reverse, followed by a period-halving 
cascade and a bifurcation back to symmetry. Finally, the branch of oscillatory 
solutions terminates with a symmetrical heteroclinic orbit that connects two 
saddle-foci. The interval with aperiodic solutions contains many pairs of 
narrow windows with asymmetrical or symmetrical periodic solutions, each with 
its own cascade. This pattern of behaviour is likely to occur when a periodic 
orbit approaches a symmetrical pair of saddle-foci with eigenvalues that

an electrically conducting Boussinesq fluid with suspended particles confined

by a stationary and uniform magnetic field parallel to the gravity field. The 
magnetically-inert suspended particles are not directly influenced by the 
magnetic field but are influenced indirectly by the magnetically responding 
carrier fluid in which they are suspended. A linear stability analysis of the

eigenvalues. The influence of various parameters on the onset of convection has 
been analysed. Six different reference steady-state temperature profiles are 
considered and their comparative influence on onset is discussed. Treating 
Marangoni number as the critical parameter it is shown that any particular 
infinitesimal disturbance can be stabilized with a sufficiently strong magnetic 
field. It is observed that the electrically conducting fluid layer with 
suspended particles heated from below is more stable compared to the classical 
electrically conducting fluid layer without suspended particles. The critical 
wave number is found to be insensitive to the changes in the suspension 
parameters but sensitive to the changes in the Chandrasekhar number. The

determine how far this geometry favours the occurrence of travelling waves. We 
therefore delineate the region of parameter space where travelling waves are 
stable, explore the ways in which they lose stability and investigate the 
physical mechanisms that are involved. In the magnetically dominated regime 
(with the plasma beta, &beta;&circ;=8), convection sets in at an oscillatory 
bifurcation and travelling waves are preferred to standing waves. Standing 
waves are stable in the strong-field regime (&beta;&circ;=32) but travelling 
waves are again preferred in the intermediate region (&beta;&circ;=128), as 
suggested by weakly nonlinear Boussinesq results. In the weak-field regime 
(&beta;&circ;&ges;512) the steady nonlinear solution undergoes 
symmetry-breaking bifurcations that lead to travelling waves and to pulsating 
waves as the Rayleigh number, R&circ;, is increased. The numerical experiments 
are interpreted by reference to the bifurcation structure in the 
(&beta;&circ;,R&circ;)-plane, which is dominated by the presence of two 
multiple (Takens-Bogdanov) bifurcations. Physically, the travelling waves 
correspond to slow magnetoacoustic modes, which travel along the magnetic field

a vertical magnetic field reveal a bewildering variety of periodic and

which rolls turning over in one direction grow at the expense of rolls turning 
over in the other, resulting in a net shear across the layer. As the 
temperature difference across the fluid is increased, two-dimensional pulsating 
waves occur, in which the direction of shear alternates. We analyse the 
nonlinear dynamics of this behaviour by first constructing appropriate 
low-order sets of ordinary differential equations, which show the same 
behaviour, and then analysing the global bifurcations that lead to these 
oscillations by constructing one-dimensional return maps. We compare the 
behaviour of the partial differential equations, the models and the maps in 
systematic two-parameter studies of both the magnetic and the non-magnetic 
cases, emphasizing how the symmetries of periodic solutions change as a result 
of global bifurcations. Much of the interesting behaviour is associated with a 
discontinuous change in the leading direction of a fixed point at a global 
bifurcation; this change occurs when the magnetic field is introduced},

photosphere, time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic convection is studied by 
numerical simulation of the magneto-anelastic equations, a model appropriate 
for low Mach numbers. Numerical solutions to the equations are generated on a 
two-dimensional Cartesian mesh by a finite-difference, predictor-corrector 
algorithm. The thermodynamic properties of the fluid are held constant at the 
rigid, stress-free top and bottom boundaries of the computational box, while 
lateral boundaries are treated as periodic. In most runs the background 
polytropic fluid configuration is held fixed at Rayleigh number R=5.44 times 
the critical value, Prandtl number P=1.8, and aspect ratio a=1, while the 
magnetic parameters are allowed to vary. The resulting dynamical behavior is 
shown to be strongly influenced by a horizontal magnetic field which is imposed 
at the bottom boundary. As the field strength increases from zero, an initially 
unsteady &ldquo;single-roll&rdquo; state, featuring complex time dependence, is 
replaced by a steady &ldquo;traveling-wave&rdquo; tilted state; then, an 
oscillatory or &ldquo;sloshing&rdquo; state; then, a steady two-roll state with 
no tilting; and finally, a stationary state. Because the magnetic field is 
matched onto a potential field at the top boundary, it can penetrate into the 
nonconducting region above. By varying the magnetic diffusivity, the 
concentrations of weak magnetic fields at the top of these flows can be shown 
to be explainable in terms of an advection-diffusion balance. (Videotape)},

Simulations of nonlinear, anelastic convection in the presence of magnetic 
fields have revealed a complex array of dynamic phenomena, including several 
kinds of nonlinear oscillations (Lantz and Sudan, 1995). In an attempt to 
identify the physical mechanism responsible for these oscillations, a simple 
model is proposed in which the full magneto-anelastic equations are replaced by 
equations for the amplitudes of only a few Fourier modes, which evolve 
according to more symmetric Boussinesq rules. Only one symmetry is permitted to 
be broken: the up-down mirror symmetry, via a tilting mode that drives a shear 
flow in the horizontal direction (Howard and Krishnamurti, 1986). The nonlinear 
interaction of just these few modes is shown to be adequate to reproduce 
qualitatively the kinds of behavior seen in simulations. Furthermore, when 
parameters in the magneto-anelastic equations are mapped onto rough Boussinesq 
equivalents, a number of quantitative comparisons can also be made; these 
confirm that the low-order, truncated model is able to capture the correct 
numerical trends in the simulation data as the Rayleigh number and the imposed 
horizontal magnetic field are varied. Video visualizations of fluid motions 
derived from the low-order equations are presented, together with their analogs 
from full MHD simulations. (Videotape, Segment 6)},

abstract = {Certain features of the Earth's magnetic field remain stationary 
for at least a sizeable fraction of the presumed convective time-scale of the 
outer core. These features may result from forced convection (laterally 
variable boundary buoyancy conditions) in the core as a result of core-mantle 
thermal coupling and the longer convective time-scale of the mantle. Although 
time-dependent motions in the core are certainly present, the observation of 
stationary features has motivated the present authors to develop a method to 
find steady, finite-amplitude solutions to the non-linear convective equations. 
The authors develop the iterative numerical method, and apply it to free 
convection (laterally uniform boundary buoyancy conditions), which is better 
understood than forced convection. Although they cannot yet be sure of the 
stability with respect to time perturbations of the solutions, the method has 
computational advantages over time-stepping that allow one to examine a large 
parameter space},

abstract = {We examine a model system where attractors may consist of a 
heteroclinic cycle between chaotic sets; this `cycling chaos' manifests itself 
as trajectories that spend increasingly long periods lingering near chaotic 
invariant sets interspersed with short transitions between neighbourhoods of 
these sets. Such behaviour is robust to perturbations that preserve the 
symmetry of the system; we examine bifurcations of this state. We discuss a 
scenario where an attracting cycling chaotic state is created at a blowout 
bifurcation of a chaotic attractor in an invariant subspace. This differs from 
the standard scenario for the blowout bifurcation in that in our case, the 
blowout is neither subcritical nor supercritical. The robust cycling chaotic 
state can be followed to a point where it loses stability at a resonance 
bifurcation and creates a series of large period attractors. The model we 
consider is a ninth-order truncated ordinary differential equation (ODE) model 
of three-dimensional incompressible convection in a plane layer of conducting 
fluid subjected to a vertical magnetic field and a vertical temperature 
gradient. Symmetries of the model lead to the existence of invariant subspaces 
for the dynamics; in particular there are invariant subspaces that correspond 
to regimes of two-dimensional flows, with variation in the vertical but only 
one of the two horizontal directions. Stable two-dimensional chaotic flow can 
go unstable to three-dimensional flow via the cross-roll instability. We show 
how the bifurcations mentioned above can be located by examination of various 
transverse Liapunov exponents},

abstract = {Patterns generated by thermal convection in a horizontal layer of 
fluid, heated uniformly from below, have been extensively studied, as it serves 
as a model for a wide variety of natural phenomena. Naturally occurring 
patterns, such as cloud formations on the Earth, are examples of thermal 
convection on a large scale. In order to understand the dynamics of thermal 
convection, we use simple models, which comprise sets of coupled differential 
equations (PDEs). Weakly nonlinear analysis of these models yields the patterns 
obtained at the onset of convection; further analysis reveals various 
instabilities to which simple patterns may be susceptible. We extend one such 
reduced model of rotating thermal convection, in which the rotation is around 
the vertical axis only, to describe rotation about an inclined axis. This model 
is more realistic for geo-/astro-physical applications. We find that the usual 
instabilities of (vertically) rotating convection can be significantly 
modified. For example, the Kiippers-Lortz instability, which forces patterns to 
precess continually about the vertical axis, may be completely suppressed when 
a non-zero horizontal component is included in the rotation vector. We also 
derive a new reduced model of magnetoconvection. In both these models the 
presence of large-scale conserved quantities can significantly affect the 
convection patterns, for example, in the magnetoconvection model the 
large-scale magnetic flux can cause complete suppression of convection in 
localised regions in the layer. In order to describe the convection beyond the 
scope of the weakly nonlinear analysis, we numerically solve the model PDEs. 
There are two functions of our numerical simulations. Firstly, we simulate the 
nonlinear evolution of the pattern once a predicted instability has occurred, 
and, secondly we investigate far-from-onset convection},

abstract = {Convective motions in the Earth's fluid core are strongly affected 
by a combination of the Coriolis and magnetic forces. For a long-timescale 
phenomenon such as the geomagnetic reversals, the Earth's magnetic fields are 
generated by dynamo processes. For a shorter-timescale phenomenon such as the 
secular variation, dynamics of the Earth's fluid core can be understood by 
examining convective motions in the presence of an imposed magnetic field 
without involving the complex dynamo processes. The present paper investigates 
both linear and nonlinear convection in a rapidly rotating fluid spherical 
shell like the Earth's fluid core in the presence of a strong axisymmetric 
toroidal magnetic field with dipole symmetry. In their linear calculation, it 
is demonstrated that magnetoconvection is nearly independent of the Ekman 
number E when E&les;10<sup>-3</sup>. In their nonlinear calculation, which 
includes all nonlinear effects, two different types of magnetoconvection 
solutions are found. The primary nonlinear solution bifurcating from the onset 
of magnetoconvection corresponds to steadily travelling magnetoconvection waves 
with equatorial and azimuthal symmetries. The secondary solution after the 
instability of the steadily travelling waves is characterised by vacillating 
magnetoconvective motions which breaks both the temporal and azimuthal 
symmetries of the primary solution simultaneously. Implication of nonlinear 
solutions for the Earth's dynamo is also discussed},

the early and middle A stars have very shallow convective layers, they are not

emission in the far-ultraviolet (905-1185 &Aring;) spectra of seven 
main-sequence A stars, based on observations from the Far Ultraviolet

effective temperature along the main sequence over which powerful subsurface 
convection zones and hence chromospheric emission are expected to vanish. The 
presence or absence of high-temperature emissions in our FUSE spectra therefore 
can be used to identify the locus for the transition from convective to 
radiative envelopes-a change in stellar structure that is difficult to assess 
by other means. We present our observations and analysis of the subcoronal

analysis of polarization spectra. The Stokes spectra contain detailed 
information on the structure and dynamics of the magnetized photospheric plasma

interpretation of high-resolution observations requires sophisticated 
techniques such as radiative transfer of polarized light in 3D model

elaborated physics and are becoming sufficiently realistic to make predictions 
about the complex processes that take place in the Sun's magnetized atmosphere. 
This paper concentrates on the diagnostics of the magnetic fields in quiet 
solar photospheric regions outside sunspots and active regions. Until recently 
the influence of the magnetic field on the dynamics of these regions was 
considered unimportant. However, it turns out that a considerable amount of 
magnetic energy is probably stored in the "quiet" Sun. The issue of quiet solar

0.4"-0.5" spatial resolution were obtained from two-dimensional Stokes V 
polarimetry in the Fe I 6302.5 &Aring; line and by image reconstruction with 
speckle methods. The simulations of magnetoconvection was performed with the 
MURAM code. It solves the time-dependent MHD equations for a compressible, 
partly ionized plasma including radiative transfer in LTE. To determine the 
fractal dimensions the perimeter-area relation is used. We discuss the 
influence of seeing and noise in the fractal dimension D of the observed 
magnetograms. A dependence of D on the distance from disk center could not be 
found. The observations give D=1.21&plusmn;0.05 for a pixel size corresponding 
to 0.105", while for the numerical simulations D=1.38&plusmn;0.07 for a pixel 
size of 20.83 km. If we use a yardstick adapted to the spatial resolution the 
observations give the dimension D=1.41&plusmn;0.05 in close agreement with the 
simulations. This agreement is remarkable since the pixel sizes and spatial 
resolutions of the simulations and of the observations differ by a factor of 
15. The finding supports the view of self-similarity of solar magnetic 
structures over a large range of scales. In addition, it demonstrates the 
realism of the simulations and suggests that all important physical processes 
are included. We discuss our results in comparison with other investigations},

in G-band bright points through the analysis of Zeeman polarization in 
molecular CH lines. To this end, we solve the equations of polarized radiative 
transfer in the G band through a standard plane-parallel model of the solar 
atmosphere with an imposed magnetic field and through a more realistic snapshot 
from a simulation of solar magnetoconvection. This region of the spectrum is 
crowded with many atomic and molecular lines. Nevertheless, we find several 
instances of isolated groups of CH lines that are predicted to produce a 
measurable Stokes V signal in the presence of magnetic fields. In part, this is 
possible because the effective Land&eacute; factors of lines in the stronger 
main branch of the CH A<sup>2</sup>&Delta;-X<sup>2</sup>&Pi; transition tend to 
zero rather quickly for increasing total angular momentum J, resulting in a 
Stokes V spectrum of the G band that is less crowded than the corresponding 
Stokes I spectrum. We indicate that, by contrast, the effective Land&eacute; 
factors of the R and P satellite subbranches of this transition tend to 
&plusmn;1 for increasing J. However, these lines are in general considerably 
weaker and do not contribute significantly to the polarization signal. In one 
wavelength location near 430.4 nm, the overlap of several magnetically 
sensitive and nonsensitive CH lines is predicted to result in a single-lobed 
Stokes V profile, raising the possibility of high spatial resolution narrowband 
polarimetric imaging. In the magnetoconvection snapshot, we find circular 
polarization signals of the order of 1%, prompting us to conclude that 
measuring magnetic field strength in small-scale elements through the Zeeman 
effect in CH lines is a realistic prospect},

abstract = {Geodynamo models depend on two important parameters: the Ekman and 
Rayleigh numbers. While the difficulty of simulating a geodynamo with very 
small Ekman number has been widely discussed, the Rayleigh number has received 
relatively little attention. The energy budget is rather tight, giving hope for 
a low Rayleigh number and a tractable problem. Entropy considerations constrain 
the Rayleigh number to be large and positive. In the special case when the 
conduction profile in the absence of convection has the same functional 
dependence on radius as the adiabatic temperature, the Rayleigh number is 
simply related to the entropies of magnetic and thermal diffusion. In general, 
the Earth's core may be stirred by both thermal and compositional convection, 
and may contain distinct stable regions where no convection occurs, but the 
same entropy argument holds and at least one of the Rayleigh numbers must be 
large and positive in at least one of the convecting regions. For molecular 
diffusivities, the Rayleigh number is enormous, 10<sup>29</sup> for thermal 
convection and 10<sup>38</sup> for compositional convection. Turbulent 
diffusivities give much lower values, 10<sup>12</sup> for thermal and 
10<sup>15</sup> for compositional convection, or 10<sup>3</sup> and 
10<sup>6</sup> times the critical Rayleigh number for magnetoconvection in a 
strong magnetic field. These values exceed the critical Rayleigh number for 
non-magnetic convection, which is higher than for magnetoconvection by a factor 
of 10<sup>3</sup> for turbulent diffusivities and 10<sup>5</sup> for molecular 
values. Convection in the Earth's core could persist even when the geomagnetic 
field becomes weak, for example during excursions or polarity reversal. The 
turbulent value for thermal convection is low enough to be reached in numerical 
simulations in the near future},

does not affect the stability of the hydromagnetic solutions obtained by Malkus 
(1967) in the limit of small &lambda;. It is solely the effect of the magnetic 
Hartmann boundary layer that causes instabilities of the otherwise stable 
solutions. When the container is a perfect conductor, &lambda;&circ;=0, the 
hydromagnetic instabilities grow at a rate proportional to the magnetic Ekman

Swedish 1 m Solar Telescope) of the rapid temporal variability of faculae, 
which occurs on granular timescales. By combining these observations with 
magnetoconvection simulations of a plage region, we show that much of this 
variability is not intrinsic to the magnetic field concentrations that are 
associated with faculae, but rather a phenomenon associated with the normal 
evolution and splitting of granules. We also show examples of facular 
variability caused by changes in the magnetic field, with movies of dynamic 
behavior of the striations that dominate much of the facular appearance at 0.1" 
resolution. Examples of these dynamics include merging, splitting, rapid 
motion, apparent fluting, and possibly swaying},

finally obtained in the fifth-order system through the complicated bifurcations

flux concentrations, we compute synthetic filtergrams from solar 
magnetoconvection models in four different passbands: two continuum bands, at 
1626 and 575 nm, the G band, and the line wing of the Ca II K line. Magnetic 
flux concentrations are selected by their G-band brightness. In the 
near-infrared the selected flux concentrations appear inconspicuous with 
intensities that are on average below that of the synthetic average quiet Sun, 
while their contrast in the visible passband is mostly positive. When we 
account for limited telescope resolution and imperfect seeing, the contrasts of 
bright points in the visible become increasingly negative as a result of mixing 
with the dark intergranular lanes in which they are embedded. The correlation 
in bright-point intensity between different passbands becomes increasingly poor 
from the G band to the visible and the near-infrared. This is caused in part by 
the varying amount of spectral lines in each of the bands. Further, we find 
that the largest magnetic field concentrations, representative of micropores or 
magnetic knots, are dark in all four passbands. The brightenings in the Ca II K 
line wing do not coincide with magnetic flux concentrations on the spatial 
scale of the simulation. Finally, we find that the rms intensity contrast in 
all four passbands depends on the amount of magnetic field present in the 
simulation, with higher contrast for lower average magnetic field strength},

crucial element in our understanding of the dimming region's evolution is 
developed by monitoring the disappearance and reappearance of bright TRACE 
"moss" around the active region that gives rise to the CME. We interpret the 
change in the TRACE moss as a proxy of the changing coronal magnetic field 
topology behind the CME front. We infer that the change in the global magnetic 
topology also results in a shift of the energy balance in the process 
responsible for the production of the moss emission while the coronal magnetic 
topology evolves from closed to open and back to closed again because, 
following the eruption, the moss reforms around the active region in almost 
exactly its pre-event configuration. As a result of the moss's evolution, 
combining our discussion with recent spectroscopic results of an equatorial 
coronal hole, we suggest that the interchangeable use of the term "transient 
coronal hole" to describe a coronal dimming is more than just a simple 
coincidence.},

abstract = {Kilogauss-strength magnetic fields are often observed in 
intergranular lanes at the photosphere in the quiet Sun. Such fields are 
stronger than the equipartition field Be, corresponding to a magnetic energy 
density that matches the kinetic energy density of photospheric convection, and 
comparable with the field B<sub>p</sub> that exerts a magnetic pressure equal 
to the ambient gas pressure. We present an idealized numerical model of 
three-dimensional compressible magnetoconvection at the photosphere, for a 
range of values of the magnetic Reynolds number. In the absence of a magnetic 
field, the convection is highly supercritical and characterized by a pattern of 
vigorous, time-dependent, 'granular' motions. When a weak magnetic field is 
imposed upon the convection, magnetic flux is swept into the convective 
downflows where it forms localized concentrations. Unless this process is 
significantly inhibited by magnetic diffusion, the resulting fields are often 
much greater than Be and the high magnetic pressure in these flux elements 
leads to their being partially evacuated. Some of these flux elements contains 
ultraintense magnetic fields that are significantly greater than B<sub>p</sub>. 
Such fields are contained by a combination of the thermal pressure of the gas 
and the dynamic pressure of the convective motion, and they are constantly 
evolving. These ultraintense fields develop owing to non-linear interactions 
between magnetic fields and convection; they cannot be explained in terms of 
'convective collapse' within a thin flux tube that remains in overall pressure 
equilibrium with its surroundings.},

columnar rolls. A global asymptotic theory is constructed that differs from 
previous local theories of the onset of convection at asymptotically small 
Ekman number, and it provides a, consistent Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin solution 
which takes account of the phase-mixing phenomenon. The asymptotic theory is 
developed to give the leading-order and first-order correction terms, including 
those from Hartmann boundary layers. Numerical solutions of the relevant

abstract = {Magnetoconvection in the Sun does not take place in the idealized 
situation in which the imposed field is vertical or horizontal. Instead, fields 
in sunspots and other active region features are inclined to the vertical, and 
so the system does not possess the left-right symmetry that is a feature of 
many analytical and numerical studies. The authors consider the nonlinear 
behavior of compressible convection in the presence of a uniform, externally 
imposed, oblique magnetic field. Numerical simulations demonstrate that all 
solutions take the form of traveling waves for angles of obliquity 
0&lt;&phi;&lt;&pi;/2. However, the structure of the convection cells, their 
wave speed, and direction depend sensitively upon the degree of nonlinearity, 
field angle, and field strength. For sufficiently vigorous convection,it is 
found that all solutions have a net horizontal velocity at the upper surface of 
the computational domain that is in the direction of the field tilt from 
vertical (whereas the total horizontal momentum is zero). In cases where the 
convection dominates over the magnetic field, the authors find the waves 
propagating in the same direction as the net surface velocity but with phase 
velocities that are typically an order of magnitude smaller. In cases where the 
field dominates over the convection, they find a similar relation in speeds but 
with waves propagating in the opposite direction. The results appear to be 
qualitatively independent of the precise boundary conditions applied to the 
field, as long as the latter do not impart a net horizontal momentum to the 
layer. (3 plates)},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulations provide a strategy for modelling large-scale 
flow when the smallest scales are not resolved. The approach relies on spatial 
filtering to eliminate scales smaller than the grid spacing, but requires 
models for the influence of the subgrid scales. We investigate four 
subgrid-scale models in numerical calculations of magnetoconvection in the 
Earth's core. Three of the models are based on eddy diffusivities, while the 
fourth is the similarity model of Bardina et al. (1980). The predictions of the 
subgrid-scale models are tested using a direct numerical simulation (DNS), 
which resolves the smallest dissipative scales. In order to achieve the 
required resolution we restrict the calculations to a small volume of the core 
with periodic boundary conditions. The grid is a cube with 
128&times;64&times;32 nodes, oriented so that the z-coordinate is aligned with 
the rotation axis and the y-coordinate is parallel to an imposed magnetic 
field. The direction of gravity may be oriented arbitrarily in the x-z plane 
and several representative cases are considered. Output from the DNS is 
filtered on to a coarser grid prior to evaluating the subgrid-scale models. The 
results are compared with estimates of the subgrid-scale heat and momentum 
fluxes calculated from the fully resolved solution. Substantial anisotropy in 
the subgrid-scale fluxes is caused by the influences of rotation and the 
imposed magnetic field. Models based on scalar eddy diffusivities are incapable 
of reproducing this anisotropy, whereas the similarity model gives a good match 
to the amplitude and spatial distribution of the subgrid-scale fluxes},

stars can be explored by comparing the results of detailed numerical 
experiments with high-resolution solar observations. We have investigated 
non-linear three-dimensional magnetoconvection in a fully compressible perfect 
gas. In this paper we study the effect of an imposed magnetic field on the 
pattern of convection in a deep stratified layer. When the field is strong 
enough to dominate the motion we find steady convection with rising plumes on a 
deformed hexagonal lattice, and a magnetic network at the upper boundary. This 
gives way to spatially modulated oscillations for weaker fields. As the field 
strength is further reduced the oscillations become more violent and irregular, 
and their horizontal scale increases. Magnetic flux moves rapidly along the 
network that encloses the ephemeral plumes; when the imposed field is 
relatively weak, intense fields appear at junctions in the network, where the 
magnetic pressure is comparable to the gas pressure and an order of magnitude 
greater than the dynamic pressure. This behaviour is related to convection in 
sunspots and plages and to the structure of intergranular magnetic fields on 
the Sun. (2 plates)},

outflows to the cell boundaries where they remain until a new supergranule is 
born in the vicinity. As part of our ongoing study of solar magnetoconvection 
using kinematic modeling, we have analyzed such a diffusion process in much 
greater detail. We find that diffusion is quite complicated. First, flux 
elements move from a cell's interior to its boundary. In an array of 
interacting plumes, the flow field then collects particles into stagnation 
points. The major part of the diffusion process consists of the motions of 
these slowly-changing stagnation points. Our kinematic models yield values of 
the diffusion coefficient that are compatible with the value (600 
km<sup>2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) quoted by Wang, Nash, and Sheeley (1989)},

the slice, and retrieved values of velocity and field strength were compared

the average photospheric level. The COG method appears reliable for measuring 
velocities in the lower half of these formation heights and for measuring field 
strength over the whole range of heights, for fields up to intermediate 
strength. Moreover, it is shown that the COG determination is independent of 
spectral resolution, making it particularly suitable for applications that 
require high throughput and a correspondingly large spectral bandpass, such as 
high spatial resolution observations with a large-diameter telescope. Finally, 
the effect of broad-angle scattering, which includes a schematic representation

abstract = {In dilute astrophysical plasmas, thermal conduction is primarily 
along magnetic field lines, and therefore highly anisotropic. As a result, the 
usual convective stability criterion is modified from a condition on entropy to 
a condition on temperature. For small magnetic fields or small wavenumbers, 
instability occurs in any atmosphere where the temperature and pressure 
gradients point in the same direction. We refer to the resulting convective 
instability as the magnetothermal instability (MTI). We present fully 
three-dimensional simulations of the MTI and show that saturation results in an 
atmosphere with different vertical structure, dependent on the boundary 
conditions. When the temperature at the boundary of the unstable layer is 
allowed to vary, the temperature gradient relaxes until the unstable region is 
almost isothermal. When the temperature at the boundary of the unstable region 
is fixed, the magnetic field is reoriented to an almost vertical geometry as a 
result of buoyant motions. This case exhibits more vigorous turbulence. In both 
cases the resulting saturated heat flux is almost one-half of the value 
expected if the conduction were purely isotropic, Q &tilde; ~ &chi;&Delta;T/L, 
where &chi; is the thermal conductivity, &Delta;T is the fixed temperature drop 
across the simulation domain, and L is the temperature gradient scale length. 
The action of the MTI results in dynamical processes that lead to significant 
transport perpendicular to the initial direction of the magnetic field. The 
resulting magnetoconvection in both cases amplifies the magnetic field until it 
is almost in equipartition with sustained subsonic turbulence. These results 
are relevant to understanding measurements of the temperature profiles of the 
intracluster medium of clusters of galaxies as well as the structure of 
radiatively inefficient accretion flows.},

under conditions typically encountered in the liquid cores of planets in the 
solar system. As a result of the supercritical behavior (enormous Rayleigh 
number) and ultrafast rotation (small Ekman number) typical of such flows, 
diffusion and viscosity act only in layers that are asymptotically thin in 
comparison with the radius of the core. These boundary layers control the 
buoyancy, the large-scale velocity, and the magnetic field observed at the 
planetary surface. The interchange of the internal layers determines the 
small-scale (unobservable) fields and the prevailing symmetry of the 
large-scale magnetic fields. It is proved for the first time that axisymmetric 
azimuthal flows dominate at large scales, while convection cells elongated 
parallel to the axis of rotation dominate at small scales. A system of 
equations is derived which is optimum for describing magnetoconvection of 
planetary cores on both large and small scales. It yields estimates in superb 
agreement with expensive numerical and experimental models of supercritical 
convection associated with rapid rotation. Such models will be capable of 
solving the MHD dynamo problem only when their algorithms are made consistent

important constraint on the dynamics of planetary magnetic fields. The authors 
point out that the adjustment to Taylor's constraint is considerably more 
difficult in the Galilean moons of Jupiter than in the Earth, e.g. simply due 
to the presence of the ambient Jovian field. In particular, if the ambient 
field is of sufficient strength, weak field solutions are disallowed. The 
`default option' of falling back to an Ekman state, if Taylor's constraint 
cannot be satisfied in any other way, is therefore no longer available. The 
magnetic field must therefore be in a Taylor state, a model-Z state, or 
something else entirely, but it cannot be in an Ekman state. The authors 
present a simple model of magnetoconvection specifically designed to explore 
this adjustment to Taylor's constraint in the limit of vanishing viscosity, in 
the presence of an ambient field. The authors find that for a weak imposed 
thermal wind, the system approaches a Taylor state as the strength of the 
ambient field is increased. Strong thermal wind solutions behave in a very 
different manner. Initially, as the ambient field strength is increased, the 
system exhibits many features, indicating that a Taylor state is being 
approached. However, it never reaches a Taylor state, evolving instead to a 
model-Z state as the ambient field strength is increased yet further},

abstract = {Nonergodic attractors can robustly appear in symmetric systems as 
structurally stable cycles between saddle-type invariant sets. These saddles 
may be chaotic giving rise to "cycling chaos." The robustness of such 
attractors appears by virtue of the fact that the connections are robust within 
some invariant subspace. We consider two previously studied examples and 
examine these in detail for a number of effects: (i) presence of internal 
symmetries within the chaotic saddles, (ii) phase-resetting, where only a 
limited set of connecting trajectories between saddles are possible, and (iii) 
multistability of periodic orbits near bifurcation to cycling attractors. The 
first model consists of three cyclically coupled Lorenz equations and was 
investigated first by Dellnitz et al. [Int. J. Bifurcation Chaos Appl. Sci. 
Eng. 5, 1243-1247 (1995)]. We show that one can find a "false phase-resetting" 
effect here due to the presence of a skew product structure for the dynamics in 
an invariant subspace; we verify this by considering a more general 
bi-directional coupling. The presence of internal symmetries of the chaotic 
saddles means that the set of connections can never be clean in this system, 
that is, there will always be transversely repelling orbits within the saddles 
that are transversely attracting on average. Nonetheless we argue that 
"anomalous connections" are rare. The second model we consider is an 
approximate return mapping near the stable manifold of a saddle in a cycling 
attractor from a magnetoconvection problem previously investigated by two of 
the authors. Near resonance, we show that the model genuinely is 
phase-resetting, and there are indeed stable periodic orbits of arbitrarily 
long period close to resonance, as previously conjectured. We examine the set 
of nearby periodic orbits in both parameter and phase space and show that their 
structure appears to be much more complicated than previously suspected. In 
particular, the basins of attraction of the periodic orbits appear to be 
pseudo-riddled in the terminology of Lai [Physica D 150, 1-13 (2001)]},

abstract = {Recent palaeomagnetic studies suggest that excursions of the 
geomagnetic field, during which the intensity drops suddenly by a factor of 
5-10 and the local direction changes dramatically, are more common than 
previously expected. The `normal' state of the geomagnetic field, dominated by 
an axial dipole, seems to be interrupted every 30-100 kyr; it may not therefore 
be as stable as we thought. The authors have investigated a possible mechanism 
for the instability of the geodynamo by calculating the critical Rayleigh 
number (R<sub>c</sub>) for the onset of convection in a rotating spherical 
shell permeated by an imposed magnetic field with both toroidal and poloidal 
components. They have found R<sub>c</sub> to be a very sensitive function of 
the poloidal field at the very small Ekman number pertaining to the core. The 
magnetic Reynolds number, and therefore the dynamo action, is equally sensitive 
to the applied field because of its dependence on the difference between the 
Rayleigh number and its critical value. This explains why numerical dynamo 
simulations at small Ekman number fail when similar magnetoconvection 
calculations succeed: the fluctuating magnetic field of the dynamo leads to 
rapid swings in convection strength that cannot be resolved numerically. The 
geodynamo may be unstable for the same reason, with the strength of convection 
varying wildly in response to the inevitable small changes in magnetic field. 
Frequent geomagnetic excursions may therefore be a manifestation of the 
instability arising from the core's very weak viscosity and the controlling 
effects of the Earth's rotation},

geodynamo models over the last five years. Advances in computer technology have 
made it possible to perform three-dimensional simulations, with thermal or 
compositional convection as the driving mechanism. These numerical simulations 
give reasonable results for the morphology and strength of the field at the 
core-mantle boundary, and the models are also capable of giving reversals and 
excursions which can be compared with palaeomagnetic observations; they also 
predict differential rotation between the inner core and the mantle. However, 
there are still a number of fundamental problems associated with the 
simulations, which are proving hard to overcome. Despite the advances in 
computing power, the models are still expensive and take a long time to run. 
This problem may diminish as faster machines become available, and new 
numerical methods exploit parallelization effectively, but currently there are 
no practical schemes available which work at low Ekman number. Even with 
turbulent values of the diffusivities (and the question of whether isotropic 
diffusivities are appropriate is still unresolved), the appropriate dynamical 
regime has not yet been reached. In consequence, modelling assumptions about 
the nature of the flow near the boundaries have to be made, and different 
choices can have profound effects on the dynamics. The nature of large-scale 
magnetoconvection at small E is still not well understood, and until we have 
more understanding of this issue, it will be difficult to have a great deal of 
confidence in the predictions of the numerical models},

in a magnetized compressible Couette flow using an energy variational 
principle, the so-called interchange or Chandrasekhar's method, which we 
applied successfully in the incompressible case. This formulation accounts for 
the simultaneous presence of gravity, rotation, a toroidal magnetic field, a 
weak axial magnetic field, entropy gradients, and density gradients in the 
initial equilibrium state. The power of the method lies in its simplicity, 
which allows us to derive extremely compact and physically clear expressions 
for the relevant stability criteria despite the inclusion of so many physical 
effects. In the implementation of the method, all the applicable conservation 
laws are explicitly taken into account during the variations of a quantity with 
dimensions of energy that we call the "free-energy function." As in the 
incompressible case, the presence of an axial field invalidates the 
conservation laws of angular momentum and azimuthal magnetic flux and 
introduces instead isorotation and axial current conservation along field 
lines. Our results are therefore markedly different depending on whether an 
axial magnetic field is present, and they generalize in two simple expressions 
all previously known, partial stability criteria for the appearance of 
magnetorotational instability. Furthermore, the coupling between magnetic 
tension and buoyancy and its influence to the dynamics of nonhomoentropic 
magnetized flows become quite clear from our results. In the limits of 
plane-parallel atmospheres and homoentropic flows, our formulation easily 
recovers the stability criteria for suppression of convective and Parker 
instabilities, as well as some related special cases studied over 40 years ago

abstract = {The generation of magnetic fields by convection in a 
rapidly-rotating, conducting fluid sphere is investigated in the presence of a 
uniform ambient field. A two azimuthal mode approximation is used, giving a 
relatively tractable system nevertheless capable of self-consistent field 
generation. In weak imposed fields, `magnetoconvective' solutions are found, 
where magnetic fields hundred of times the ambient field strength can be 
generated from the latter by convection incapable of self-sustained dynamo 
action. The polarity of ambient field determines that of the generated field. 
Such solutions are only stable for relatively weak applied fields, and 
relatively weakly driven convection; outside this regime, the system is 
unstable to stronger field solutions which are essentially self-sustained 
dynamos. Although the ambient field is less important for these solutions, for 
sufficient ambient field strengths it still leads to enhanced generated field 
strengths and imposes a fixed polarity. Both solution types may be of some 
relevance to the moons of the giant planets},

numerical simulations require an artificially large magnetic diffusivity, which 
smears out magnetic structures smaller than the grid scale. Assuming a 
turbulent cascade for the unresolved artificially smeared magnetic fields, we 
find that their unsigned magnetic flux is at least as important as that 
explicitly shown in the simulation. The unresolved fields do not produce Zeeman 
polarization but contribute to the unsigned flux. Since they are not considered 
by Khomenko et al., their mean magnetic field strength has to be regarded as a 
lower limit. This kind of bias is not specific of a particular numerical 
simulation or a spectral line. It is to be expected when observed quiet Sun 
Zeeman signals are compared with synthetic signals from simulations},

the waves propagate rapidly eastwards and concentrate just outside the "tangent

inner sphere. When the poloidal field is comparable to the toroidal field the 
waves also propagate eastwards but concentrate inside the tangent cylinder. 
When the toroidal field is larger than the poloidal field the waves propagate 
slowly either eastwards or westwards and concentrate on lower to middle 
latitudes. In all the three cases, the flow approximately satisfies the 
two-dimensional Proudman-Taylor constraint, even though the theorem does not

thermal convection in a small rectilinear domain placed tangentially on a 
rotating sphere at latitude 45&deg;. The spatiotemporal evolution of convection 
is studied in an initially non-homogeneous toroidal magnetic field located at 
the interface of a 2-layer unstable/stable polytropic stratification. The 
effects from a variation of the rotation rate and magnetic field strength are 
explored. In weak field convection the solutions bear close resemblance to the 
field-free situation with the magnetic field treated as a passive ingredient. 
In this case a significant amount of magnetic energy is transported downwards 
into the stable layer by penetrative motions where the field is concentrated in 
small-scale tube-like features. In the case of a dominating magnetic field, the 
overall structure of convection changes dramatically towards a two-dimensional, 
more laminar flow with convective motions occurring in columnar cells aligned 
with the mean magnetic field. The latter quickly becomes flat in the convection 
zone due to magnetic buoyancy effects. Magnetic quenching of the flow heavily 
influences the mixing properties of convection, thereby, reducing the fluxes of 
kinetic energy and enthalpy and suppressing the downward transport of magnetic 
energy. Adding rotation in strong field convection generates streaming motions 
parallel to the mean field. These motions contain a large fraction of the total 
kinetic energy. The horizontally-averaged (mean) flows, on the other hand, are 
less energetic. In the presence of strong rotation the horizontal mean flows 
are triggered by inertial oscillations. Averaging the mean flows over time 
gives an estimate for steady flows persistent in a convection zone. Whereas the 
vertical flow component obtained in this way shows a systematic dependence on 
the rotation rate and field strength, the flows in the meridional and zonal 
directions depend in a more complex manner on these parameters. This includes 
reversals in their orientation when going from moderate to strong rotation and 
when increasing the magnetic field strength},

keep the problem numerically tractable. We consider two statistical approaches, 
the opacity distribution function (ODF) concept and the multigroup (or opacity

from the application of these methods in the context of 2D/3D simulations. In a 
first step, the ODF- and multigroup methods are applied to a 1D 
model-atmosphere and the resulting radiative heating rates are compared. A 
number of 4-6 frequency bins is found to warrant a satisfactory modeling of the 
radiative energy exchange. Further tests in 2D model-atmospheres show the 
applicability of the multigroup method in realistic situations and underline 
the importance of a non-grey treatment. Furthermore, we address the question of 
an appropriate opacity average in multigroup calculations and discuss the

of convection and magnetic field as a process of general astrophysical 
relevance. Moreover, understanding magneto-convection and the evolution of 
magnetic flux in the lower atmosphere is essential for addressing key problems 
of solar physics (origin of the magnetic field, variability of the solar 
output, heating of the upper atmosphere). While the various layers of the solar 
envelope are connected and coupled by the magnetic field, the crucial 
magneto-convective processes in the photosphere take place on spatial scales of 
the order of 100 km. Therefore, observational approaches toward solving these 
problems are most promising if they follow two complimentary paths: a) 
`synoptic' view of the entire solar envelope, and b) spectroscopic measurements 
with high spatial resolution},

sources and sinks of the horizontal supergranular flows. The convection that 
produces the supergranulation is small in horizontal extent, 7 Mm, and 
organized into vertical upward and downward convective plumes rather than 
closed cells. Mass continuity places a strong constraint on the vertical extent 
of the horizontal velocities indicating that the horizontal supergranular flows 
can extend no more than 2.4 Mm below the solar surface. Though 30 Mm is the 
scale of the chromospheric network, quite a different scale for magnetic 
features is discovered in active regions, 5 to 15 Mm. I describe a model 
showing that the discrepancy between apparent cell sizes in quiet and active 
regions may be understood as an effect of differing rates of flux emergence},

is permeated by a strong uniform horizontal magnetic field aligned with the

axis. The ratio of the magnitudes of the Lorentz and Coriolis forces is 
characterized by the Elsasser number, &Lambda;, and the ratio of the thermal 
and magnetic diffusivities, <i>q</i>. By heating the fluid from below and 
cooling from above the system becomes unstable to small perturbations when the 
adverse density gradient as measured by the Rayleigh number, <i>R</i>, is 
sufficiently large. With the viscosity ignored the geostrophic velocity, 
<i>U</i>, which is aligned with the applied magnetic field, is independent of 
the coordinate parallel to the rotation axis but is an arbitrary function of 
the horizontal cross-stream coordinate. At the onset of instability the value 
of <i>U</i> taken ensures that Taylor's condition is met. Specifically the 
Lorentz force, which results from marginal convection must not cause any 
acceleration of the geostrophic flow. It is found that the critical Rayleigh 
number characterising the onset of instability is generally close to the 
corresponding value for the usual linear problem, in which Taylor's condition 
is ignored and <i>U</i> is chosen to vanish. Significant differences can occur 
when <i>q</i> is small owing to a complicated flow structure},

abstract = {Three main mechanisms have been described to determine the maximum 
field strength and structure of a solar or stellar magnetic flux tube. This 
paper attempts to relate them to one another through a series of 
magnetoconvective calculations. The first process is the balancing of the 
Lorentz force by radial gradients in the buoyancy force. It was first found in 
the Boussinesq regime, where it was studied in the late 1970s by Galloway, 
Proctor &amp; Weiss. A similar balance can occur in the fully compressible 
case, where we refer to it as quasiBoussinesq (QB). The second process involves 
a balance between an outward-directed radial pressure gradient and radial 
gradients in the buoyancy force outside the tube. This is the mechanism 
proposed in the early 1990s by Kerswell &amp; Childress (the KC mechanism). The 
third mechanism, convective collapse (CC), is a process whereby a flux tube can 
evolve to a high field strength because of an instability due to the 
superadiabaticity of the material within the tube. Until now, it has been 
studied using the so-called 'thin flux tube' approximation in which convective 
motions are ignored even though there is a background superadiabatic density 
stratification. Here we place these three mechanisms in a unified framework and 
explore the transitions between the solutions as various parameters are varied. 
In particular, we show that the QB solutions are preferred for a wide range of 
parameters, whereas CC solutions occur only in very specific circumstances. In 
particular, on the Sun, the latter are probably limited to flux tubes with 
radii less than approximately 10 km, the turbulent magnetic diffusivity

well defined configurations. This report presents an experimental study of the 
influence of a horizontal magnetic field on the integral heat transfer and the 
temporal behavior of liquid metal Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection. For this 
specific flow configuration the magnetic field exerts not only a damping effect 
on the convective motions by Joule's dissipation, the non-isotropic character 
of the electromagnetic forces gives rise to the transition of the 
three-dimensional convective flow patterns into increasingly two-dimensional 
structures in the sense that convective rolls become aligned with the magnetic

Small brightenings within umbrae (some of which may be classified as umbral 
dots) have magnetic fields nearly equal to those of the darker surroundings. 
These features are nearly at rest with respect to their surroundings. The 
absence of significant motions in umbral dots implies that radiation transports 
most of the energy at and immediately below the surface. If convective plumes 
transport energy below the surface of sunspot umbrae, they must have both a 
lateral extent and a depth of their upper boundary comparable to (or smaller 
than) the size of the dot. These inferences suggest that umbral dots are the 
surface signature of a small-scale magnetoconvective process that is quenched

However, the difficulties are twofold: (1) the reliability of the proxies and 
(2) the need for some physical mechanism relating these proxies to the solar 
luminosity. On the basis of a better understanding of the solar machinery the 
authors now propose a plausible scenario connecting the exchanges of energy 
between the various reservoirs: magnetic, thermal, gravitational, and kinetic. 
In the present paper the available proxies are discussed and a way to 
reconstruct total solar irradiance over the past four centuries is suggested. 
The response of the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamique atmospheric general 
circulation model to magnetoconvective solar forcing during the Maunder minimum 
is discussed. The simulated cooling appears to be compatible with temperature 
data from the Little Ice Age; in addition, it is found that variations of 
globally homogeneous external forcing parameters, like incoming solar flux or 
greenhouse gas loading, yield climate responses with very similar geographical 
patterns},

abstract = {For pt.I see ibid., vol.108, p.247 (1981). Nonlinear, 
two-dimensional magnetoconvection has been investigated numerically for a fixed 
Rayleigh number of 10<sup>4</sup>, with the ratio &zeta; of the magnetic to the 
thermal diffusivity in the range 0.4&ges;&zeta;&ges;0.05. As the Chandrasekhar 
number <i>Q</i> is decreased, convection first sets in as overstable 
oscillations, which are succeeded by steady convection with dynamically active 
flux sheets and, eventually, with kinematically concentrated fields. In the 
dynamical regime spatially asymmetrical convection, with most of the flux on 
one side of the cell, is preferred. As <i>Q</i> increases, these asymmetrical 
solutions become time-dependent, with oscillations about the steady state which 
develop into large-scale oscillations with reversals of the flow. Although 
linear theory predicts that narrow cells should be most unstable, the nonlinear 
results show that steady convection occurs most easily in cells that are 
roughly twice as wide as they are deep},

abstract = {For a variety of reasons, based on results from magnetoconvection, 
self-consistent dynamo calculations and helioseismology, it seems plausible 
that the bulk of the solar magnetic field is located in the overshoot zone. 
Furthermore, it has also been suggested that the solar dynamo is operating in 
this region. The aim of this paper is then to show that it is possible to 
obtain a mean electromotive force (EMF), and hence an &alpha;-effect, in the 
convectively stable overshoot zone, which is driven by magnetic buoyancy 
instabilities. By investigating the stability of a layer of magnetic field 
embedded between two nonmagnetic layers of plasma we are able to show the 
following: first, that magnetic buoyancy instabilities indeed give rise to a 
mean EMF and, secondly, that the electromotive force is largest in the region 
where the magnetic layer is unstable, i.e. where the field strength decreases 
fastest with height. Moreover, the influence of the rotation rate and the 
magnetic field strength on the magnetic buoyancy instability has been 
investigated in order to determine for which values of these parameters dynamo 
action might occur},

Overstable magnetoconvection has been invoked as a possible driving mechanism 
for waves and oscillations in sunspots and for rapid oscillations observed in 
Ap-stars. The Alfven-gravity spectrum is computed for four sequences of 
equilibrium configurations that differ by the profiles of the Brunt-Vaisala 
frequency and the Alfven frequency, and hence, by the Alfven continuum. The 
evolution of the spectrum is determined for increasing strength of the magnetic 
field, and, the dependency of the spectrum on the profiles of the Brunt-Vaisala 
frequency and the Alfven frequency is investigated},

abstract = {Estimates of the molecular values of magnetic, viscous and thermal 
diffusion in the Earth's core suggest turbulent small-scale velocity, magnetic 
and temperature fluctuations. Instability arguments (Braginsky and Meytlis 
1990) indicate that the viscous and thermal diffusions of the resulting 
turbulence are strongly anisotropic, the directions of anisotropy being 
determined by the mean magnetic field, the rotation of the core, the mean 
temperature gradient and gravity. Physical principles and invariance arguments 
are used to constrain the forms of the turbulent viscous stress tensor to eight 
types and the turbulent heat flux vector to a single type. The models are 
interpreted in terms of angular momentum, kinetic energy and entropy exchange 
between the mean and fluctuating fields. For the development of the turbulence 
models in spherical geometries, general non-linear spectral expansions are 
derived for one of the turbulent viscous stress tensors, the turbulent heat 
flux vector and their divergences using vector and tensor spherical harmonic 
methods and poloidal-toroidal representations. The spectral expansions, which 
are complicated and would be difficult to derive using other methods, include 
all invariance terms and can be programmed directly from the explicit forms 
given, thus laying the foundation for future computational studies of core 
turbulence. They are particularly suitable for linearised problems, such as 
anisotropic convection and magnetoconvection. The spectral techniques employed 
are applicable to all eight turbulent viscous stress tensors},

abstract = {Thermal convection of liquid metals is considerably influenced by 
imposing an external magnetic field. Such magnetoconvective flows control the 
heat and tritium removal from the breeding material in current fusion blanket 
designs. A magnetic field may be used to influence the heat transfer controlled 
solidification in material processing like casting or crystal growth. As the 
geometries of technical applications are rather complex, a fundamental 
understanding of the phenomena may only be obtained from simple well defined 
configurations. This report presents an experimental study of the influence of 
a vertical magnetic field on the integral heat transfer and the temporal 
behavior of liquid metal Rayleigh-B&eacute;nard convection. At this specific 
configuration the horizontal symmetry of the convective flow patterns is not 
changed by the electromagnetic forces and therefore the magnetic field exerts 
mainly a damping effect on the convective motions by Joule's dissipation. The 
test section is a rectangular box of large aspect ratio 20:10:1 whereby a 
parameter range of Rayleigh numbers 0&lt;Ra&lt;10<sup>5</sup> and Chandrasekhar 
numbers 0&lt;Q&lt;14400 is covered. The Prandtl number of test fluid sodium 
potassium Na<sup>22</sup>K<sup>78</sup> is very small i.e. Pr&ap;0.02 and 
therefore the nonlinear inertial forces lead to strong time dependent flow. The 
integral heat transfer across the layer is characterized by the Nusselt number, 
calculated from the time averaged temperatures at the upper and the lower 
boundary. Local, time-dependent temperatures are evaluated from a four-element 
temperature probe placed in the middle of the liquid metal layer. The 
non-coplanar arrangement of the thermocouples enables the evaluation of the 
time-dependent temperature gradient vector which allows to estimate the local 
isotropy properties of the time dependent flow},
