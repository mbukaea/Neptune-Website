abstract = {A technique for analyzing dispersion properties of numerical schemes is proposed. The method is able to deal with both non dispersive or dispersive waves, i.e. waves for which the phase speed varies with wavenumber. It can be applied to unstructured grids and to finite domains with or without periodic boundary conditions. We consider the discrete version L of a linear differential operator C. An eigenvalue analysis of L gives eigenfunctions and eigenvalues (I<sub>i</sub>, \&lambda;<sub>i</sub>,). The spatially resolved modes are found out using a standard a posteriori error estimation procedure applied to eigen- modes. Resolved eigenfunctions I<sub>i</sub>'s are used to determine numerical wavenumbers k<sub>i</sub>'s. Eigenvalues' imaginary parts are the wave frequencies &lt;w, and a discrete dispersion relation &omega;<sub>i</sub>, = f(k<sub>i</sub>) is constructed and compared with the exact dispersion relation of the continuous operator C. Real parts of eigenvalues &lambda;<sub>i</sub> 's allow to compute dissipation errors of the scheme for each given class of wave. The method is applied to the discontinuous Galerkin discretization of shallow water equations in a rotating framework with a variable Coriolis force. Such a model exhibits three families of dispersive waves, including the slow Rossby waves that are usually difficult to analyze. In this paper, we present dissipation and dispersion errors for Rossby, Poincare and Kelvin waves. We exhibit the strong superconvergence of numerical wave numbers issued of discontinuous Galerkin discretizations for all families of waves. In particular, the theoretical superconvergent rates, demonstrated for a one dimensional linear transport equation, for dissipation and dispersion errors are obtained in this two dimensional model with a variable Coriolis parameter for the Kelvin and Poincare waves.}}

abstract = {The thermal confinement time of a magnetized fusion plasma is essentially determined by turbulent heat conduction across the equilibrium magnetic field. To achieve the study of turbulent thermal diffusivities, Vlasov gyrokinetic description of the magnetically confined plasmas is now commonly adopted, and offers the advantage over fluid models (MHD, gyrofluid) to take into account nonlinear resonant wave-particle interactions which may impact significantly the predicted turbulent transport. Nevertheless kinetic codes require a huge amount of computer resources and this constitutes the main drawback of this approach. A unifying approach is to consider the water-bag representation of the statistical distribution function because it allows us to keep the underlying kinetic features of the problem, while reducing the Vlasov kinetic model into a set of hydrodynamic equations, resulting in a numerical cost comparable to that needed for solving multifluid models. The present paper addresses the gyro-water-bag model derived as a water-bag-like weak solution of the Vlasov gyrokinetic models. We propose a quasilinear analysis of this model to retrieve transport coefficients allowing us to estimate turbulent thermal diffusivities without computing the full fluctuations. We next derive another self-consistent quasilinear model, suitable for numerical simulation, that we approximate by means of discontinuous Galerkin methods.}}

abstract = {A mixed continuous and discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization is constructed for a generalized vorticity streamfunction formulation in two spatial dimensions. This formulation consists of a hyperbolic (potential) vorticity equation and a linear elliptic equation for a (transport) streamfunction. The generalized formulation includes three systems in geophysical fluid dynamics: the incompressible Euler equations, the barotropic quasi-geostrophic equations and the rigid-lid equations. Multiple connected domains are considered with impenetrable and curved boundaries such that the circulation at each connected piece of boundary must be introduced. The generalized system is shown to globally conserve energy and weighted smooth functions of the vorticity. In particular, the weighted square vorticity or enstrophy is conserved. By construction, the spatial finite-element discretization is shown to conserve energy and is <i>L</i><sup>2</sup>-stable in the enstrophy norm. The method is verified by numerical experiments which support our error estimates. Particular attention is paid to match the continuous and discontinuous discretization.

In this approach, the domain is decomposed into two regions, and appropriate transmission conditions are applied at the interface between regions.

Design/methodology/approach - A non-parabolic six-valley model allows for the investigation of anisotropy effects. The solution method is based on a discontinuous piecewise polynomial approximation of the carrier distribution function. Integrating the Boltzmann equation over tiny cells of the phase space leads to a system of ordinary differential equations. The Poisson equation is selfconsistently solved by applying a finite element Galerkin approach. Findings - Good agreement with shock-capturing "WENO solutions" is obtained for n<sup>+</sup>-n-n<sup>+</sup> silicon diodes. The anisotropy due to the six-valley model affects considerably macroscopic quantities at the beginning of the transients. The method is also applicable to spatially two-dimensional problems. Research limitations/implications - The presented method is extendable by including full band structure data, although the method is much easier applicable when analytical band structure models can be used. Practical implications - The new model is an efficient tool to acquire transport coefficients for device simulations or to directly simulate one- or two-dimensional submicron devices on a kinetic level. Originality/value - New grounds are broken by introducing a fast finite volume method for solving the Boltzmann equation in the spirit of finding a weak solution. The presented model is a good choice for the simulation of anisotropy effects in silicon semiconductor devices}}

The quality of the numerical results is remarkable, since the discontinuities are very well captured without the appearance of spurious oscillations. These results are compared with those obtained by using the standard parabolic model and the local DG (LDG) method and with those given by the parabolic model and the Bassi-Rebay scheme.

abstract = {Many production steps used in the manufacturing of integrated circuits involve the deposition of material from the gas phase onto wafers. Models for these processes should account for gaseous transport in a range of flow regimes, from continuum flow to free molecular or Knudsen flow, and for chemical reactions at the wafer surface. We develop a kinetic transport and reaction model whose mathematical representation is a system of transient linear Boltzmann equations. In addition to time, a deterministic numerical solution of this system of kinetic equations requires the discretization of both position and velocity spaces, each two-dimensional for 2-D/2-D or each three-dimensional for 3-D/3-D simulations. Discretizing the velocity space by a spectral Galerkin method approximates each Boltzmann equation by a system of transient linear hyperbolic conservation laws. The classical choice of basis functions based on Hermite polynomials leads to dense coefficient matrices in this system. We use a collocation basis instead that directly yields diagonal coefficient matrices, allowing for more convenient simulations in higher dimensions. The systems of conservation laws are solved using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method. First, we simulate chemical vapor deposition in both two and three dimensions in typical micron scale features as application example. Second, stability and convergence of the numerical method are demonstrated numerically in two and three dimensions. Third, we present parallel performance results which indicate that the implementation of the method possesses very good scalability on a distributed-memory cluster with a high-performance Myrinet interconnect}}

abstract = {Several important manufacturing processes for integrated circuits (ICs) involve the flow of gaseous reactants over the wafer(s) on which the ICs are being made. We discuss a model in which reactive components of the gas phase do not collide; either because there is a dominant carrier species, or the pressure is low enough. The kinetic transport and reaction model consists of a system of transient linear Boltzmann equations for the reactive species in the flow. This model applies to a wide range of transport regimes, characterized by a wide range of Knudsen numbers as a function of pressure and length scale of interest. A numerical simulator based on a spectral Galerkin method in velocity space approximates each linear Boltzmann equation by a system of transient conservation laws in space and time with diagonal coefficient matrices, which are solved using the discontinuous Galerkin method. This deterministic solver gives direct access to the kinetic density that is the solution to the Boltzmann equation, as a function of position, velocity, and time. The availability of the kinetic density as a function of velocity is useful to analyze the underlying kinetic causes of macroscopic observables. Using chemical vapor deposition as an important application example, the influence of process parameters is studied in transient two-dimensional and three-dimensional features that represent structures seen during integrated circuit fabrication for a wide range of Knudsen numbers. The results highlight the capabilities of the KTRM and its implementation, and indicate that kinetic solvers may be needed for models characterized by Knudsen numbers on the order of unity. This regime applies both to feature scale simulators at certain operating conditions and to intermediate scale models used as part of multiscale simulators.}}

abstract = {A number of contributions have been made during the last decades to model pure-diffusive transport problems by using the so-called hyperbolic diffusion equations. These equations are used for both mass and heat transport. The hyperbolic diffusion equations are obtained by substituting the classic constitutive equation (Fick's and Fourier's law, respectively), by a more general differential equation, due to Cattaneo (C R Acad Sci Ser I Math 247:431-433, 1958). In some applications the use of a parabolic model for diffusive processes is assumed to be accurate enough in spite of predicting an infinite speed of propagation (Cattaneo, C R Acad Sci Ser I Math 247:431-133, 1958). However, the use of a wave-like equation that predicts a finite velocity of propagation is necessary in many other calculations. The studies of heat or mass transport with finite velocity of propagation have been traditionally limited to pure-diffusive situations. However, the authors have recently proposed a generalization of Cattaneo's law that can also be used in convective-diffusive problems (Gomez, Technical Report (in Spanish), University of A Corufia, 2003; Gomez et al., in An alternative formulation for the advective-diffusive transport problem. 7th Congress on computational methods in engineering.

abstract = {This paper describes the development of two optimal discontinuous finite element (FE) Riemann methods and their application to the one-speed Boltzmann transport equation in the steady-state. The proposed methods optimise the amount of dissipation applied in the streamline direction. This dissipation is applied within an element using a novel Riemann FE method, which is based on an analogy between control volume discretisation methods and finite element methods when integration by parts is applied to the transport terms. In one-dimension the optimal finite element solutions match the analytical solution exactly at each outlet node. Both schemes couple elements in space via a Riemann approach. The first of the two schemes is a Petrov-Galerkin (PG) method which introduces dissipation via the equation residual. The second scheme uses a streamline diffusion stabilisation term in the discretisation. These two methods provide a discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin (DPG) scheme that can stabilise an element across the full range of radiation regimes, obtaining robust solutions with suppressed oscillation. Three basis functions in angle of particle travel have been implemented in an optimal DPG Riemann solver, which include the PN (spherical harmonic), SN (discrete ordinate) and LWN (linear octahedral wavelet) angular expansions. These methods are applied to a series of demanding two-dimensional radiation transport problems..}}

abstract = {A discontinuous Galerkin shallow water model on the cubed sphere is developed, thereby extending the transport scheme developed by Nair et al. The continuous flux form nonlinear shallow water equations in curvilinear coordinates are employed. The spatial discretization employs a modal basis set consisting of Legendre polynomials. Fluxes along the element boundaries (internal interfaces) are approximated by a Lax-Friedrichs scheme. A third-order total variation diminishing Runge-Kutta scheme is applied for time integration, without any filter or limiter. Numerical results are reported for the standard shallow water test suite. The numerical solutions are very accurate, there are no spurious oscillations in test case 5, and the model conserves mass to machine precision. Although the scheme does not formally conserve global invariants such as total energy and potential enstrophy, conservation of these quantities is better preserved than in existing finite-volume models}}

abstract = {A new two-dimensional advection test on the surface of the sphere is proposed. The test combines a solid-body rotation and a deformational flow field to form moving vortices over the surface of the sphere. The resulting time-dependent deforming vortex centers are located on diametrically opposite sides of the sphere and move along a predetermined great circle trajectory. The horizontal wind field is deformational and nondivergent, and the analytic solution is known at any time. During one revolution around the sphere the initially smooth transported scalar develops strong gradients. Such an approach is therefore more challenging than existing advection test cases on the sphere. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed test, three different advection schemes are employed, such as a discontinuous Galerkin method on a cubed-sphere mesh, a classical semi-Lagrangian method, and a finite-volume algorithm with adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) on a regular latitude-longitude grid. The numerical results are compared with the analytic solution for different flow orientation angles on the sphere.}}

abstract = {Ultrashort-pulsed laser irradiation on metals creates a thermal nonequilibrium between electrons and the phonons. Previous computational studies used the two-temperature model and its variants to model this nonequilibrium. However, when the laser pulse duration is smaller than the relaxation time of the energy carriers or when the carriers\&psila; mean free path is larger than the material dimension, these macroscopic models fail to capture the physics accurately. In this paper, the nonequilibrium between energy carriers is modeled via a numerical solution of the Boltzmann transport model (BTM) for electrons and phonons, which is applicable over a wide range of lengths and time scales. The BTM is solved using the discontinuous Galerkin finite element method for spatial discretization and the three-step Runge-Kutta temporal discretization. Temperature dependent electron-phonon coupling factor and electron heat capacity are used due to the strong electron-phonon nonequilibrium considered in this study. The results from the proposed model are compared with existing experimental studies on laser heating of macroscale materials. The model is then used to study laser heating of gold films, by varying parameters such as the film thickness, laser fluence, and pulse duration. It is found that the temporal evolution of electron and phonon temperatures in nanometer size gold films is very different from the macroscale films. For a given laser fluence and pulse duration, the peak electron temperature increases with a decrease in the thickness of the gold film. Both film thickness and laser fluence significantly affect the melting time. For a fluence of 1000 J/m<sup>2</sup>, and a pulse duration of 75 fs, gold films of thickness smaller than 100 nm melt before reaching electron-phonon equilibrium. However, for the film thickness of 2000 nm, even with the highest laser fluence examined, the electrons and phonons reach equilibrium and the gold film does not melt.}}

These dynamic mesh adaptation approaches are investigated using benchmark cases. Numerical results demonstrate that the three approaches resolve time-dependent transport adequately without slope limiting for both long-term and short-term simulations. It is shown that these results apply to problems where either diffusion or advection dominates in different subdomains. Moreover, for these schemes, mass conservation is retained locally during dynamic mesh modification. Comparison studies indicate that the anisotropic mesh adaptation provides the most efficient meshes and has the least numerical diffusion among the three adaptation approaches.}}
